# Rule: `quotes`

**Order:** 40. **Default:** on. **Modes:** text, html, markdown, yaml.
**Spec version:** 1.4.0 (0.4.1 for everything except the universal medial-`n` elision veto
(1.1.0) and the span-boundary elision veto (1.4.0), both described in §3.2 and in the History
section below).

---

## 0. What changed from 0.1.0, and why it is a rewrite rather than a patch

0.1.0's whole architecture rested on one sentence: *the rule reasons about the straight input
marks and never about the curly output glyphs.* Two operator decisions withdraw that sentence:

1. **Any existing quote glyph is a re-typesetting candidate**, this locale's own or a foreign
   one. `«Wort»` in German prose becomes `„Wort“`. Same principle as `dashes` §3.2 step 2a
   applies to dash length: a quote glyph's identity in ordinary prose is at least as often a
   copy-paste artefact or unfamiliarity as a deliberate choice, and an author who wants their own
   typography untouched has always had the option of not running the pipeline. **0.1.0 §3.8 is
   withdrawn.**
2. **A space touching a quote mark is sloppiness, not evidence.** `" hello"` is `“hello”`; the
   space is deleted. `« bonjour »` is a formed pair on the first application, not only after
   `nbsp` has touched it.

Once every quote glyph is a candidate, **the rule's input alphabet equals its output alphabet**,
and 0.1.0's idempotency proof — whose first line is "a converted position is not a candidate in
pass 1 of the second run" — is not weakened, it is **false**. Three ideas replace it, and each
closes one class of the four defects that motivated this revision:

| Idea | Closes |
| --- | --- |
| **Glyph-blindness (Lemma A, §5).** Every quote mark belongs to `QUOTEMARK`, which is a member of *both* `OPENISH` and `CLOSEISH` and exempt from `canOpen`'s closeish rejection. A candidate's verdict never depends on *which* quote glyph its neighbour is. | neighbour drift; `apostrophe` (R₆) becomes structurally invisible as a neighbour |
| **Directional space-skipping (Lemma B, §5).** `canOpen` skips a space on its inner (right) side, `canClose` on its inner (left) side, unconditionally; each reads its *outer* side literally, except at the two positions `nbsp` can insert — derived from locale data, not hand-picked. | mandate 2; a run-1/run-2 asymmetry across an `nbsp`-inserted space; an HTML span boundary the same shape exposed |
| **Certification (the gate, §3.5).** The accepted pairing is *checked*, not proved: render the hypothetical output, re-run passes 1–2 on it, and decline pairs until the re-run reproduces the accepted set exactly. | width drift interacting with an unmatched candidate — the one remaining non-invariance, and provably non-local |

The division of labour is the point. **Lemmas A and B cover what the gate cannot see** — edits
made by *other* rules after `quotes` has run. **The gate covers everything `quotes` itself
does** — instabilities in the vetoes, the width partition, the depth assignment — without
anyone having to enumerate them by hand. A future change to the capability tests can break
quality; it cannot break idempotency, because the gate checks the actual re-derivation rather
than trusting an argument about it.

---

## 1. Purpose

`quotes` resolves every quotation mark in the text — typewriter (U+0022, U+0027) or typographic
(`«`, `“`, `„`, `‘`, `”`, …), the locale's own or a foreign locale's — into the pair of glyphs
the locale prescribes, alternating between the primary and secondary pairs by nesting depth, and
normalising the spacing immediately inside each pair.

---

## 2. Locale data consumed

- `quotes.primary.open` / `.close` / `.innerSpace`
- `quotes.secondary.open` / `.close` / `.innerSpace`
- `quotes.elisionIdioms` (spec 0.4.0) — an array of `{ left, elided, right }` triples, each a
  literal string, consulted only by the **listed elision veto** (§3.2) to **decline** pairing
  two `NARROW` marks as a quotation when the full context matches: the elided content between
  the marks, the word immediately before the opening mark, and the word immediately after the
  closing mark (`rock 'n' roll`'s `{ left: "rock", elided: "n", right: "roll" }`). May be
  empty, and empty is the default for a locale with no verified idiom of this shape. A
  decline-only list can never widen what this rule pairs, only narrow it — the same principle
  stated normatively in `nbsp.md` §2.1 and governing every list-valued field in
  `locale.schema.json`.

  **All three fields are required, and matching `elided` alone is deliberately not a supported
  shape.** A bare word list cannot distinguish an idiom from an arbitrary quotation of the same
  word — `The letter 'n' is common.` and `He said "press 'n' now".` are both genuine
  quotations of the letter *n*, and a list keyed on `elided` alone would falsely elide both.
  The surrounding context is the evidence that makes `rock 'n' roll` an idiom and these two
  sentences ordinary prose; §3.2 states exactly how much of it must match.

  **`left` and `right` must consist entirely of `LETTER` code points** — §3.2's Word definition
  is a maximal `LETTER` run, and a `left`/`right` entry is normatively *authored as* that word.
  This is not a limit the matcher itself enforces at match time: the comparison in §3.2 is a
  literal code-point equality test, so a configured entry containing a digit or punctuation
  code point would still match those exact bytes wherever they occur, not fail to match at all.
  The constraint exists precisely because the matcher does not check it — an unvalidated entry
  could make the veto fire on text no citation ever attested, silently exceeding what the
  normative Word definition authorises. `scripts/validate-spec.mjs` and `scripts/gen-locales.mjs`
  therefore reject such an entry at the data boundary, before it can be authored into a locale
  file at all. `elided` carries no such constraint: its match is a literal equality test over
  the raw code points between the two marks, not a `LETTER`-run walk, so it may contain any
  non-empty literal. Both validators read the identical pinned table `src/engine/unicode.ts`
  imports (`scripts/lib/is-letter.mjs`), so validation and the runtime engine cannot classify a
  code point differently.

- `quotes.elisionClitics` (spec 1.4.0) — an object with two arrays, `before` and `after`, each
  a list of literal lowercase strings, consulted only by the **span-boundary elision veto**
  (§3.2) to **decline** pairing a `NARROW` mark as a quotation when the mark is flush against an
  inline span boundary on one side and a listed word fragment on the other. Both lists may be
  empty, and empty is the default for a locale with no citable closed set of such fragments.

  **Both lists are defined positionally, not by what the fragment attaches to.** `before` is
  matched against the maximal `LETTER` run ending immediately *before* the mark; `after` against
  the run beginning immediately *after* it. Attachment direction is the linguistic motivation for
  an entry, never the test — and the two do not coincide here, because the whole point of this
  veto is that the word the fragment attaches to may be on the far side of a span boundary and
  therefore absent from the rule's input. In `` `x`'s `` the possessive attaches back to the `x`
  inside the code span, yet what stands to the mark's left is the `MARKER`; the fragment this
  field must name is the `s` on the **right**. Reading the lists as attachment claims makes
  `after` look inert (a fragment with a `LETTER` on each side is already vetoed as medial) and is
  the one misreading to guard against.

  - **`before`** — French `l'`, `d'`, `qu'`, `jusqu'` give `l`, `d`, `qu`, `jusqu`; Portuguese
    `d'`, `n'`, `pel'`, `Sant'` give `d`, `n`, `pel`, `sant`; Italian `l'`, `un'`, `d'`.
  - **`after`** — English `x's` gives `s`; Dutch `'s morgens`, `'t was`, `'ns kijken` give `s`,
    `t`, `ns`.

  **An entry is the whole maximal run, never a prefix of one.** French needs `jusqu`, `lorsqu`,
  `puisqu` and `quoiqu` as entries of their own: the run in `jusqu'à` is `jusqu`, so an entry
  `qu` cannot match it. The same arithmetic is why Italian's `l` does not cover `dell'arte` (the
  run is `dell`), which makes a partial list honest rather than misleadingly narrow.

  "Elision" here covers the possessive, exactly as `apostrophe.md` §3.3 case 3 does in its own
  name ("Trailing elision or possessive") — English `'s` is not an elision and is the one entry
  that locale has.

  **Every code point of every entry must be a `LETTER`**, and an entry must be non-empty. The
  constraint is enforced at the data boundary by `locale.schema.json` and by
  `scripts/validate-spec.mjs`, for the reason §3.2 gives: the matcher walks a maximal `LETTER`
  run, so an entry containing anything else could never match and would be dead data rather than
  a rejected claim. Entries are authored **lowercase**; §3.2's matcher folds only the first code
  point, and only ASCII `A`–`Z`, so `L'` matches an entry `l` and `QU'` does not match `qu`.
  What is *enforced* at the data boundary is exactly that much and no more: an entry whose first
  code point is ASCII `A`–`Z` is rejected, because the fold makes it unmatchable by
  construction. An entry capitalised in a script the fold does not reach is not rejected — it is
  simply matched as written, which is well-defined and identical in every runtime, so the
  authoring convention is stated as a convention rather than as a validated constraint.

  **The leniency is therefore Latin-only in effect, and that is a scoping fact, not an
  oversight.** A Cyrillic or Greek entry cannot serve: `ru`'s own cited example is `Д'Аламбер`
  with a capital U+0414, which a lowercase entry `д` will not match, while an uppercase entry
  would miss `д'Артаньян` in the same citation. Widening the fold is `ARCHITECTURE.md` §4.4's
  banned territory (no locale-dependent case mapping — Turkish dotless ı), so a locale whose
  script the fold does not reach is `[]` on mechanism grounds, before its orthography is even
  consulted. `ru`, `uk` and `el` are `[]` for exactly this reason as well as their own.

  A decline-only pair of lists can never widen what this rule pairs, only narrow it — the same
  principle `elisionIdioms` above rests on, stated normatively in `nbsp.md` §2.1 and governing
  every list-valued field in `locale.schema.json`. Both lists empty makes the veto a total
  no-op and classifies every mark exactly as spec 1.3.1 did.

`innerSpace` is read and acted on in **one direction only**: `quotes` *deletes* an inner space
when the assigned pair's `innerSpace` is `"none"`, and never inserts or converts one. Insertion
and conversion stay with `nbsp` (order 70), exactly as 0.1.0 always said. See §3.7.

### 2.1 Two new normative locale constraints

Both are needed by §5's proof. **All ten shipped locales already satisfy both**, verified against
`spec/locales/*.json`:

- **Q-W — a pair is width-homogeneous.** For each of `primary` and `secondary`, `open` and
  `close` must have the same quote *width* (§3.1). Without it a formed pair straddles both
  stacks after rendering and the gate would decline every pair in a same-glyph document.
- **Q-A — a spaced pair must not use the apostrophe glyph.** If `innerSpace ≠ "none"`, neither
  `open` nor `close` may be U+2019. Without it `apostrophe`'s output would land in a
  `nbsp`-insertion-adjacent skip set and Lemma A's corollary would break.

One constraint belongs to `nbsp`'s data and is stated normatively in `nbsp.md` §2:

- **Q-P — every code point in `nbsp.beforePunctuation` and `nbsp.narrowBeforePunctuation` must
  be a member of this rule's `CLOSEISH`.** This is what makes Lemma B cover N1/N2 as well as N8.
  The shipped lists (`:`, `;`, `!`, `?` in `fr`/`fr-CA`, empty elsewhere) satisfy it.

**Evidence for locale data.** A locale attests **membership**; the rule owns the **mechanism**.
Stated normatively in `nbsp.md` §2.1; it governs every locale field this rule reads.

## 3. Algorithm

Input is a code-point array `cp[0 … n-1]`. Five passes plus an emit; no backtracking inside a
pass, no regular expression, no native-string indexing.

### 3.1 Character classes

| Class | Members |
| --- | --- |
| `DQ` | U+0022 |
| `SQ` | U+0027 |
| `STRAIGHT` | `DQ` ∪ `SQ` |
| `WIDE` | U+0022, U+00AB, U+00BB, U+201C, U+201D, U+201E, U+201F, U+301D, U+301E, U+301F |
| `NARROW` | U+0027, U+2018, U+2019, U+201A, U+201B, U+2039, U+203A |
| `QUOTEMARK` | `WIDE` ∪ `NARROW` (disjoint) |
| `DIGIT` | U+0030–U+0039 |
| `LETTER` | general categories `Lu Ll Lt Lm Lo Mn Mc Me` |
| `ALNUM` | `LETTER` ∪ `DIGIT` |
| `BREAK` | U+000A, U+000D, U+000B, U+000C, U+0085, U+2028, U+2029, plus `LINE_MARKER` |
| `INLINE-SPACE` | U+0020, U+0009, U+00A0, U+202F, U+2007, U+2009, U+200A |
| `SPACELIKE` | `INLINE-SPACE` ∪ `BREAK` |
| `OPENISH` | U+0028 `(` U+005B `[` U+007B `{`, `MARKER`, ∪ `QUOTEMARK` |
| `CLOSEISH` | U+0029, U+005D, U+007D, U+002C, U+002E, U+003B, U+003A, U+0021, U+003F, U+2026, U+2013, U+2014, `MARKER`, ∪ `QUOTEMARK` |
| `DASHISH` | U+002D, U+2011, U+2013, U+2014 |
| `DELETE-LANDING` | `ALNUM` ∪ `QUOTEMARK` |
| `NONE` | the pseudo-class "index out of range" |

**`QUOTEMARK` is a member of both `OPENISH` and `CLOSEISH`, and is exempt from `canOpen`'s
closeish rejection** — the same dual membership `STRAIGHT` had in 0.1.0, widened to the whole
class. This is Lemma A's entire mechanism and must not be simplified back to per-glyph lists.
`MARKER` keeps its 0.1.0 treatment (`modes.md` §3.3): in both classes, exempt from the
rejection, and **not** in `SPACELIKE`, so no skip walk ever crosses a span boundary.

**Deliberately excluded from `QUOTEMARK`:** U+2032/U+2033 (primes — a separate rule with its own
false-positive profile, §7), U+02BC (a `Lm` letter), U+0060 and U+00B4. Neither candidates nor
produced.

**Unicode version.** As 0.1.0: the pinned UCD in `spec/UNICODE` is normative for the derived
tables, not for the host runtime (`pipeline-idempotency.md` §6a).

**A declared quote glyph must not be in `SPACELIKE`, `ALNUM` or `STRAIGHT`**, and by Q-W must
share its pair's `WIDE`/`NARROW` bucket with its partner glyph. `singleChar` in
`locale.schema.json` enforces the `STRAIGHT` exclusion.

### 3.1a Locale-derived skip sets

Computed once per call, from locale data alone:

```
SPACE-RIGHT = { p.open  : p ∈ {primary, secondary}, p.innerSpace ≠ "none", p.open ≠ p.close }
SPACE-LEFT  = { p.close : p ∈ {primary, secondary}, p.innerSpace ≠ "none", p.open ≠ p.close }
```

These are **exactly the positions at which `nbsp` N8 can insert a space** (`nbsp.md` §3.10;
`nbsp.ts` `quotesSubRule` skips a pair whose `open` equals its `close`, and skips
`innerSpace: "none"`). For the ten shipped locales: `SPACE-RIGHT = {«}` and `SPACE-LEFT = {»}`
in `fr` and `fr-CA`; both empty everywhere else. The sets are derived from the *reason*, not
hand-written — if a locale gains a spaced pair, they follow automatically and Lemma B keeps
holding.

### 3.2 Pass 1 — collect and classify candidates

Walk `i` from `0` to `n-1`. Skip unless `cp[i] ∈ QUOTEMARK`. Write `g = cp[i]` and compute four
neighbour reads:

- `Llit = cp[i-1]`, or `NONE`; `Rlit = cp[i+1]`, or `NONE`;
- `Lskip` = the first `cp[j]`, `j < i` descending, with `cp[j] ∉ INLINE-SPACE`; `NONE` if the
  walk leaves the array;
- `Rskip` = symmetric to the right.

`MARKER` and every `BREAK` stop a skip walk, because neither is in `INLINE-SPACE` — a skip never
crosses a span boundary or a line terminator.

Then two *directed* reads:

- `openLeft` = `Lskip` if `g ∈ SPACE-LEFT`, else `Llit`;
- `closeRight` = `Rskip` if `g ∈ SPACE-RIGHT`, else `Rlit`.

The two capabilities:

```
canOpen  ⟺ ( openLeft = NONE ∨ openLeft ∈ SPACELIKE ∨ openLeft ∈ OPENISH ∨ openLeft ∈ DASHISH )
         ∧ ( Rskip ≠ NONE ∧ Rskip ∉ SPACELIKE
             ∧ ( Rskip ∉ CLOSEISH ∨ Rskip ∈ QUOTEMARK ∨ Rskip = MARKER ) )

canClose ⟺ ( Lskip ≠ NONE ∧ Lskip ∉ SPACELIKE )
         ∧ ( closeRight = NONE ∨ closeRight ∈ SPACELIKE ∨ closeRight ∈ CLOSEISH ∨ closeRight ∈ DASHISH )
```

`Rskip`/`Lskip` can still be a `BREAK` (a skip walk stops there), which is why both
`∉ SPACELIKE` tests are retained: a mark at a line end does not open across the break, a mark at
a line start does not close back over it.

**Why this exact asymmetry.**

- `canOpen` skips right and `canClose` skips left: each capability treats its *inner* side — the
  side facing the quoted text under that hypothesis — as noise. That is mandate 2, stated once
  and applied uniformly, unconditionally, on every locale.
- Each capability reads its *outer* side literally. The outer space is not noise, it is the
  evidence. `"hi" to me` is a closing mark **because** a space follows it; skipping that space
  (reading `t`) would destroy the commonest closing shape in every language. `He said "hi. She
  said "bye."` is preserved by exactly this: the first mark's `closeRight` is the letter `h`, so
  it is `canOpen` only, and the stray mark cannot swallow the real quotation.
- The two exceptions to "outer side is literal" are *derived*, not chosen: `nbsp` can insert on
  the right of a `SPACE-RIGHT` glyph and the left of a `SPACE-LEFT` glyph, and those are the only
  two outer reads it can reach. Making exactly those two reads skip is what makes every verdict
  inert to `nbsp` (Lemma B).

**Medial-elision veto** (`NARROW` marks only, literal reads):

> if `g ∈ NARROW` and `Llit ∈ ALNUM` and `Rlit ∈ ALNUM`, set both capabilities false.

`don't`, `l'été`, `O'Brien`, `1990's` — and, on a second pipeline pass, `don't` with U+2019,
because `apostrophe` has converted the mark and U+2019 is also `NARROW`. Widening from `SQ` to
`NARROW` is what makes `apostrophe`'s output inert here.

**Listed elision veto** (spec 0.4.0, `NARROW` marks only, locale data `quotes.elisionIdioms`,
literal reads). **Matching the elided content alone is not this veto's shape.** A bare word
list cannot distinguish `rock 'n' roll` from an arbitrary quotation of the same word —
`The letter 'n' is common.` and `He said "press 'n' now".` are both genuine quotations that a
content-only match would falsely elide (this was tried and rejected in an earlier revision of
this field; both sentences are pinned as negative fixtures, `spec/fixtures/en-US.json`). The
veto therefore requires the **full context**: the elided content, and a literal word on each
outer side of the two marks.

> **Word.** A maximal run of `LETTER` code points. Its outer boundary — the code point
> immediately before its first code point, or immediately after its last — is either `NONE`
> (document or span start/end) or **not** `LETTER` and **not** `DIGIT`. This is a whole-word

`rock 'n' roll` with `elisionIdioms = [{ left: "rock", elided: "n", right: "roll" }]`: the
leading mark's `left` word is `rock`, the elided run spells exactly `n`, the trailing mark's
`right` word is `roll` — all three match, both marks are vetoed, survive pass 1 as U+0027, and
`apostrophe` (order 50) renders each independently: leading elision (`apostrophe.md` §3.3 case
4) on the first, trailing elision (case 3) on the second, giving `rock ’n’ roll`. Without the
veto both marks are `canOpen`/`canClose` candidates in their own right — the leading mark has
no `ALNUM` on its left so the medial veto above does not apply to it, and likewise for the
trailing mark's right — and pass 2 pairs them as an ordinary quotation.

**This is a bounded, literal check, not a heuristic.** The lookahead from `i` and `j` is
bounded by the total length of `left` + `elided` + `right` for each configured idiom — no
regex, no priorities, no open-ended word class; the same shape `nbsp.md`'s
`beforeNumber`/`beforeWord` literal matching already uses on one side of a mark
(`nbsp.md` §3.11), applied here to both sides of a pair of marks at once. It can only ever
**prevent** a pairing pass 2 would otherwise have formed — an empty `quotes.elisionIdioms`
makes it a total no-op, and every `NARROW` mark is classified exactly as it was before spec
0.4.0.

**Behaviour at punctuation and document boundaries.** Trailing punctuation after `right` (a
period, a comma, a closing quotation mark) does not block the match: the word-boundary test
only requires the code point after `right`'s last letter to be non-`LETTER`/non-`DIGIT`, and
punctuation satisfies that trivially (`I love rock 'n' roll.` still vetoes; §6 row P3).

**A context word may itself begin at document/span start or end at document/span end — the
Word definition above already says so (`NONE` is an accepted outer boundary).** `Rock 'n' roll
is great.`, where `Rock` is the very first thing in the document, still vetoes (§6 row P2): the
mark's own left neighbour `cp[i-1]` is a real `INLINE-SPACE` code point (the space after
`Rock`), and `wordEndsAt` finds `Rock` ending there with a legal `NONE` boundary one step
further left. **What cannot happen is the mark itself sitting at that extremity.** A `NARROW`
mark at the very start or end of the text unit has `Llit`/`Rlit` = `NONE`, which is not
`INLINE-SPACE`, so its own outer test fails before a word is even sought — the veto needs an
actual space *and* an actual word beyond it, and a mark with nothing to its outer side has
neither. The constraint is on the mark's adjacency, not on where the word may fall.

**Membership evidence, not mechanism**, stated normatively in `nbsp.md` §2.1 and governing every
list-valued field in `locale.schema.json`: a locale attests that a `{ left, elided, right }`
triple belongs in this list; this rule owns the mechanism. Each triple is independently
evidenced — `{ left: "rock", elided: "n", right: "roll" }` is cited (§6, `en-US.json`
`sources`), and that citation supports no other triple: it does not, for instance, attest
`{ left: "fish", elided: "n", right: "chips" }`, which is not listed here and would need its
own citation before being added. This is deliberately **not** a general elision-word list, and
it must not grow into one merely because the mechanism could technically encode it. A locale
with no citable evidence for a triple of this exact shape ships an empty list rather than a
guessed one — the same discipline `PLAN.md` §6.1 states for every locale field, and the reason
this veto is populated for only one locale at launch (§6).

**Known, accepted residual ambiguity — not eliminated by the full-context requirement.** The
veto has no notion of authorial intent: it matches code points, not meaning, so a document that
explicitly states its own intent to write three separate tokens — the word `rock`, a genuinely
quoted letter `n`, and the word `roll` — and then, for illustration, reproduces the identical
surface sequence `rock 'n' roll`, still gets that final occurrence vetoed:

```
The sequence is the word rock, the quoted letter 'n', and the word roll: rock 'n' roll.
```

transforms to

```
The sequence is the word rock, the quoted letter “n”, and the word roll: rock ’n’ roll.
```

The **first** `'n'` is correctly left alone: its `left` context is `letter`, not `rock`, and it
is immediately followed by a comma rather than a space, so no configured idiom matches and it
pairs as an ordinary depth-1 quotation — exactly the mechanism §6 rows N1/N2 already prove. The
**second** occurrence — `rock 'n' roll` at the end — matches `left`/`elided`/`right` exactly,
regardless of the fact that the same sentence has just told the reader it is meant as a literal
concatenation of the three tokens just described, not a fresh invocation of the idiom. **Under
the authorial intent the sentence itself states, this conversion is a real semantic false
positive** — the final `'n'` is meant as a repetition of the same quoted letter named earlier in
the sentence, not the idiom, and eliding it changes what the author wrote to mean. It is
accepted as an **unavoidable** false positive for a bounded, surface-form contract, not a
tolerated one: `left`, `elided`, `right` and the single permitted `INLINE-SPACE` on each side
are the entire alphabet this veto is defined over, and none of them can encode "this is a
demonstration, not an utterance of the idiom" — no finite extension of that alphabet could,
short of the veto reasoning about meaning, which is out of scope for a literal, bounded
contract (§3.2). The implementation still **conforms exactly** to its own normative matcher on
this input: the two occurrences are given the treatment the matcher's rules specify byte for
byte, and the defect is that the matcher's contract cannot distinguish these bytes from the
idiom it exists to recognise — because, written this way, they are the same bytes. Recorded
here in the same spirit as `dashes.md` §7.9, and §6 row N6 pins it as a fixture, so the exposure
is visible in the conformance suite rather
than discovered in someone's content.

**Universal medial-`n` elision veto (spec 1.1.0).** The listed elision veto above closes
`rock 'n' roll` for `en-US`, where a citation exists. It closes nothing for `en-GB`, `de-DE`,
`de-CH`, `fr`, `fr-CA`, `ru`, `fi`, `sv` or `el`, whose `elisionIdioms` lists are empty. Without a
further mechanism the marks in `rock 'n' roll` fall through to ordinary pairing in all nine and
are typeset as a quotation.

**Operator decision, 2026-09-09: `rock 'n' roll` and `rock'n'roll` are international, and both
take U+2019 in every locale.** The idiom is not a locale fact — it is a fixed borrowed string that
appears untranslated in prose in all ten — so the mechanism is locale-blind and lives in this rule
rather than in locale data. Locale data could not carry it in any case: the `sources` discipline
(§2) would block an entry in a locale whose own orthography writes the borrowing out instead
(Russian writes рок-н-ролл), and an entry withheld for that reason would leave uncovered exactly
the locales this decision is about.

The predicate (`src/rules/quote-ambiguity.ts`, `computeAmbiguousShapeIndices`) is **this rule's
alone** as of spec 1.1.0. Under 0.5.0 `apostrophe` consulted the same module to decide what to skip;
it no longer skips anything, so the module has one caller and there is nothing left for the two
rules to drift apart on. The shape: a pair of `NARROW` marks enclosing **exactly one code point**,
either U+006E `n` or U+004E `N`, with **at least one** `INLINE-SPACE` code point immediately
outside each mark. `rock 'n' roll`, `fish 'n' chips` and `rock 'N' roll` all match;
`She chose 'A' today`, `They said 'no' yesterday` and `say 'yes' now` do not, and pair as ordinary
quotations.

The closed-up form `rock'n'roll` is not this veto's business at all — the medial-elision veto
above already declines both marks on `ALNUM` neighbours, and `apostrophe` converts them. It needs
no special case and gets none.

**Why `NARROW` and not straight ASCII only — an idempotency obligation, not a preference.** Spec
0.5.0's predicate matched U+0027 alone. That was sound *there*, because its outcome was to
preserve the author's straight marks byte-identically, so a second pipeline pass saw the same
bytes and re-vetoed. This veto instead lets `apostrophe` **convert** both marks to U+2019, and a
straight-only predicate therefore would not recognise its own output: pass 2 would pair
`rock ’n’ roll` as an ordinary `NARROW` quotation on the next run. Measured, not argued — with a
straight-only predicate, `rock ’n’ roll` becomes `rock «n» roll` in `ru` and `rock ”n” roll` in
`fi`, an idempotency violation and so a release blocker (`pipeline-idempotency.md` §1). Matching
the whole `NARROW` class makes the converted form a fixed point in all ten locales.

**Why exactly one code point `n`, and not a letter-count shape.** 0.5.0's predicate matched 1 to 3
`LETTER` code points, which cannot tell the idiom from an ordinary short nested quotation and
declined both — `«это 'моё' дело»` in `ru`, `“He said 'no' to me,”` in `en-US`. Counting letters
is wrong here twice over. It is too broad: a genuine short quotation is far commoner in prose than
the idiom, so declining it is the larger error. And it is not normalization-stable — `LETTER`
includes `Mn` (§3.1) and this rule never normalizes its input (`ARCHITECTURE.md` §4.3), so `'моё'`
is three `LETTER` code points composed and four decomposed, and the same visible word took two
different branches depending on which form the author's editor happened to save. A comparison
against a fixed pair of code points has no such dependency.

**"At least one", deliberately, not "exactly one".** Only the single code point immediately
adjacent to each mark is tested; a longer run of inline spaces further out — `rock  'n'  roll`,
doubled — does not invalidate the match. Narrowing this to "exactly one" was considered and
rejected: it would make a doubled-space variant of `rock 'n' roll` fall through to ordinary
quote-pairing, reintroducing a false-positive quotation conversion the veto exists to prevent, in
exchange for no compensating benefit. The existing listed-idiom matcher (above) may remain
stricter on this point without contradiction — with extra spaces its own literal `left`/`right`
word-boundary test can fail to match the cited en-US `rock`/`n`/`roll` tuple, and when it does,
this veto still wins and the marks are still converted.

**Every position this shape matches is added to the same veto set the listed-idiom check
populates**, and both mechanisms have the identical outcome: `quotes` declines the pairing, both
marks survive pass 2 unmatched, and `apostrophe` (order 50) renders each independently by its own
structural case ladder — leading elision (`apostrophe.md` §3.3 case 4) on the first, trailing
elision (case 3) on the second, giving `rock ’n’ roll`. `en-US`'s cited `elisionIdioms` entry now
vetoes a strict subset of what this veto vetoes; it is retained because the listed mechanism
matches multi-code-point `elided` content this one does not, and because the two can never
disagree about a position both cover. **Spec 0.5.0's preserve set is withdrawn**
(`computePreserveIndices`, `apostrophe.md` §3.4): it existed to stop `apostrophe`'s case ladder
from converting marks 0.5.0 wanted preserved, and conversion is now the specified outcome for
every position this veto matches, so `apostrophe` needs no knowledge of the veto at all and its
ordinary ladder does the right thing unaided.

**Already-curly input is matched, and preserved as typed.** A pair typed directly with U+2019 is
in `NARROW`, so it is vetoed like any other — and since `apostrophe` emits U+2019 only in place of
U+0027 (`apostrophe.md` §1), it edits nothing there: `rock ’n’ roll` is a fixed point, and
`rock ‘n’ roll` keeps the author's own U+2018 rather than being re-typeset as that locale's
quotation. This is the direct opposite of 0.5.0's rule for curly input, and the reason is the
idempotency obligation two paragraphs above, not a change of view about authorial intent.

**Accepted false positive, recorded rather than tolerated.** `The letter 'n' is common.` becomes
`The letter ’n’ is common.` — a genuine quotation of the letter *n*, rendered as an elision. So
does the same shape one level deeper, `He said "press 'n' now".` Both are pinned as fixtures
(`spec/fixtures/en-US.json`) so the exposure sits in the conformance suite rather than in
someone's content. The veto's alphabet is one code point and the spaces around it; nothing in that
alphabet can encode "this is a quoted letter, not an elided one", and no bounded literal contract
over these bytes could. The trade is deliberate and was made with the numbers in view: 0.5.0 paid
for this same shape by declining **every** short quotation in **every** locale, a far larger and
far commoner class of error than quoting the single letter *n*.

**Span-boundary elision veto (spec 1.4.0, `NARROW` marks only, locale data
`quotes.elisionClitics`, literal reads).** The two vetoes above both need a real code point on
each side of the mark. `modes.md` §3.2's boundary marker is not one, so in `html` and `markdown`
a mark written flush against an inline span — `` `x`'s ``, `<code>x</code>'s`, `*x*'s`,
`l'<em>idée</em>` — has a `MARKER` where the attaching word would be, escapes both, and is
classified as an ordinary quotation candidate. `Llit = MARKER` is in `OPENISH`, so the mark
`canOpen`; inside a quotation it has a partner to take, and the accepted pairing inverts:
`He says 'avoid `` `x` ``'s printer.' Done.` was typeset with the possessive opening the
quotation and the author's opening mark demoted to a closing glyph, in every locale (issue #53,
measured on 1.3.1).

This veto reads the attaching word instead of the missing code point:

> For a mark at `i` with `cp[i] ∈ NARROW`, **both** tests below are evaluated and either firing
> sets both capabilities false.
>
> - **`Llit = MARKER`** (the mark is flush against a span boundary on its left). Let `R` be the
>   maximal run of `LETTER` code points starting at `i+1`, and `outer` the code point after that
>   run, or `NONE`. If `R` is non-empty, `outer ∉ ALNUM`, and `R` equals an entry of
>   `quotes.elisionClitics.after` — **every code point exact, except the first, which folds
>   ASCII `A`–`Z` to `a`–`z` by code point and nothing else** — then veto.
> - **`Rlit = MARKER`.** Symmetric: `L` is the maximal `LETTER` run *ending* at `i-1`, `outer`
>   the code point before it, and the comparison is against `quotes.elisionClitics.before`.
>
> The folding is the one `elisionIdioms` already specifies, for the same reason and by the same
> mechanism — never a platform locale function (`ARCHITECTURE.md` §4.4).

**One literal neighbour must be the marker, and that is the whole scope of this veto.** With a
real code point on both sides the medial-elision veto above already declines the same shape
(`x's` needs no span boundary to be a possessive), so this one adds nothing there and is not
consulted. In `text` mode that makes the veto vacuous: no marker is produced at all, so a
locale's lists cannot change what `text` does.

**In `yaml` the veto is reachable only if the scan ever puts two spans on one line, and it must
not be special-cased either way.** `modes.md` §3.5 step 2 says the −2 line marker is the
*common* case there, not the only one, so this document does not claim the veto is unreachable
in `yaml`. What it does claim is narrower and checkable: the scan yields no spans at all inside
a flow collection (`modes.md` §3.8.4 step 9), and a block mapping carries one key per line, so no
construction has yet been exhibited in which two `yaml` spans are separated by a gap without a
line terminator — and a −2 marker is in `BREAK`, which neither test reads. Whether a −1 is
constructible in `yaml` is **open**, and nothing here depends on the answer, because the trigger
is the marker and not the mode: **a runtime must not implement this veto behind a
`mode == "yaml"` test, or any other mode test.** Two modes agreeing on identical characters is
`modes.md` §7.4's requirement, and a mode conditional here would break it the moment such a
construction is found.

**The run is compared whole, never as a prefix.** `<em>'sure'</em>` mid-sentence has the run
`sure`, which is not an entry, and pairs as the quotation it is; a prefix test would have matched
the entry `s` and eaten it. The `outer ∉ ALNUM` test is what makes the run maximal in the
direction it grows — without it `` `x`'st `` would match `s`.

**What was tried and rejected: letting the `MARKER` count as content in the medial-elision
veto.** The obvious one-line fix — treat `MARKER` as satisfying that veto's `ALNUM` test, on the
marker-adjacent side or on both — was implemented and measured, and it is wrong. It cannot
separate a possessive from a quotation that legitimately *begins or ends* at a span boundary,
which is the shape `modes.md` §3.3 put the marker in `OPENISH` and `CLOSEISH` to support in the
first place. Its witnesses are the `NARROW` forms of those rows — `<em>'fine'</em>` and
`'a'<code>x</code>'b'` — and only those: this veto and the medial one are both stated over
`NARROW`, so the `WIDE` rows `modes.md` §3.3 writes with U+0022 are untouched by either variant
and are witnesses for a different mistake (removing the marker from the classes outright).
Measured on polytypo-js: both variants break the released conformance fixture
`en-us-markdown-commonmark-boundary-nested-quotes` (`*'hi'*` ⟶ `*’hi’*`, where `*‘hi’*` is
pinned), and the symmetric variant additionally breaks every quotation whose closing mark abuts a
span — `<em>He said 'hi'</em>`. A clitic list is narrower than the marker: it fires on
`` `x`'s `` and not on `` `x`'fine' ``, which no test over the marker alone can do, because the
marker is the same code point in both.

**Accepted false positive, recorded rather than tolerated.** A quotation inside an inline span
whose content is *exactly* a listed fragment is read as an elision:
`He said <em>'s'</em> loudly.` becomes `He said <em>’s’</em> loudly.`, and `Il dit <em>'l'</em>
ici.` likewise in `fr`. This is the same exposure, and strictly narrower than, the universal
medial-`n` veto's accepted `The letter 'n' is common.` — it needs the span boundary as well as
the single-fragment content. `'x'`, `'no'`, `'fine'` and `'sure thing'` in the same position are
unaffected; the class is bounded by the lists, which are short and cited. Pinned as fixtures.

**What this veto does not close, and why no veto can.** A *plural* possessive after a span —
`` `xs`' printer `` — has the marker on its left and a space on its right, so its attaching run
is empty and neither test above applies. That shape is also, code point for code point, a
quotation's closing mark after a span (`'<em>hello</em>'`, a `modes.md` §3.3 row), so no test
over these neighbours can separate them. It remains a closing candidate, and because pairing is
resolved per document it remains able to close a mark far away: with `en-GB`,

```
A 'stray mark here.

Then 'inner' text.
```

typesets as `A ’stray mark here.` / `Then ‘inner’ text.`, and appending `See `` `x`' `` data.`
re-pairs the first mark with the new one, making the middle pair nested and changing a line the
edit did not touch. Measured on 1.3.1 and unchanged by this veto.

**This is issue #53 §3, and as of 2026-09-24 it is decided rather than open: the behaviour
stands.** The report's own trigger lines are
`` `quotes`' locale data `` and `` `dashes`' own admissibility `` — plural possessives, exactly
this shape — so the cross-paragraph effect it documents in a real article is *not* repaired by
spec 1.4.0. Measured on this change, `markdown`/`commonmark`, `en-GB`:
`It is 'the `` `quotes`' `` locale data' here.` gives
`It is ‘the `` `quotes`’ `` locale data’ here.` — the plural possessive closes the quotation two
words early and the author's own closing mark is left to `apostrophe` as a stray U+2019. §1 of
that issue is closed by the veto above; §3 is not, and is not going to be.

**Why §3 is decided and not merely unfixed.** Two measurements, both on a published package.

First, **the U+2019 at the possessive's own position is produced by the pairing, and nothing else
can produce it.** `apostrophe` cannot reach that mark: its left neighbour is the inline `MARKER`,
which §3.1 deliberately keeps out of [apostrophe.md](apostrophe.md) §3.1's `CLOSEDELIM`, and its
right neighbour is a space, so no case in that rule's ladder fires. Measured on published 1.6.1,
`markdown`/`commonmark`, `en-GB`: `` The `xs`' printer works. `` comes back **unchanged** — an
unmatched span-boundary plural possessive keeps its U+0027. So the cost of this behaviour is a
consumed *pairing*, and the visible symptom of that appears elsewhere (a stray U+0027 at the real
closing mark, or a middle paragraph re-nested from `‘ ’` to `“ ”`) — but declining the mark does
not buy the right glyph in exchange. It moves the straight mark rather than removing it. An
earlier revision of this paragraph claimed the glyph was "correct either way"; it is not, and the
measurement above is what replaced the claim.

Second, **separating the two readings was implemented and measured, and it is a trade rather than
a fix.** The narrowest local veto that can do it — decline a `NARROW` mark whose literal
neighbour is `MARKER` and whose attaching `LETTER` run is empty — breaks **6 of the 1366 fixture
cases** (7 tests in polytypo-js's runner, which counts each case's idempotency re-run separately;
the denominator to reproduce is the suite's case count in [CONFORMANCE.md](../CONFORMANCE.md),
never a runtime's test total). Five are `tr` cases that are correct today:
`tr-html-span-boundary-suffix-declined`,
`tr-markdown-commonmark-span-boundary-suffix-declined`,
`tr-html-span-boundary-quotation-outside-the-span`,
`tr-html-span-boundary-non-ascii-initial-fragment` and `tr-html-span-boundary-ordinal-fragment`.

The sixth is this section's own fixture, `en-gb-markdown-commonmark-span-boundary-plural-possessive-not-closed`,
and it is the one worth reading: the veto does exactly what it is aimed at and still comes out
wrong. `He says 'avoid `` `xs`' `` printer.' Done.` typesets today as
`He says ‘avoid `` `xs`’ `` printer.' Done.` — pair closed two words early, author's own mark left
straight. Under the veto it becomes `He says ‘avoid `` `xs`' `` printer.’ Done.` — the pair now
closes at the author's mark, which is right, and the typewriter apostrophe has moved to the
possessive, which is not, for the reason the first measurement gives. That is this section's own
claim — no test over these neighbours can separate a plural possessive from a closing mark after a
span — turned from an argument into a number, and into a second output nobody would fixture.

**Operator decision (2026-09-24): where no exact answer exists, choose one behaviour and pin it
rather than leave the rule undefined.** Five runtimes agreeing byte-for-byte is the product; an
undecided rule is worse than an arbitrary decided one. The pinned behaviour is the one specified
here and fixtured at §6 row S5. A future change would have to be a **pairing-preference**
mechanism, not a classification test, and §3.3's three-outcome partition is the premise §5's
certification theorem rests on — so it replaces that premise rather than extending it, and needs
its own idempotency argument. Nobody should spend that on this without a new reason.

**V1 — same-V1-identity adjacency veto** (both widths):

> Define `V1ID(c) = U+2019 if c = U+0027, else c` — the **V1 identity** of a code point. `V1ID`
> is the identity function everywhere except at U+0027; it is *not* a claim that a given U+0027
> will become U+2019 (see below). Let `gapInsertable = g ∈ SPACE-RIGHT ∨ g ∈ SPACE-LEFT`. If
> `V1ID(Llit) = V1ID(g)`, or (`Llit ∈ INLINE-SPACE` and `V1ID(Lskip) = V1ID(g)` and
> `gapInsertable`), set both capabilities false. Symmetrically for `Rlit`/`Rskip`.

`""`, `''`, `««`, `””` and any longer run of one glyph, by the first (literal) clause. This is
0.1.0's veto, generalised, and it keeps the `"""a""` witness dead and `"a "" b"` intact.
**Granularity is deliberately "same V1 identity", not "same width"**: the narrower test
reproduces both witnesses, and a width-based test would veto the ordinary mixed boundary `"'`.

**`V1ID` and why V1 cannot compare raw code points (spec 0.4.1).** `apostrophe` (R₆) is the one
rule ordered after `quotes` that can change a candidate's own code point, and every edit it makes
replaces a U+0027 with U+2019 — the only code point it ever emits for that position
(`apostrophe.md` §1). **This is not an unconditional mapping.** `apostrophe`'s own case ladder
(`apostrophe.md` §3.3) leaves a U+0027 unedited under two of its six cases — the **prime guard**
(case 1: `6' 2"`, a foot/inch mark) and **case 5** (`a ' b`, `''`: nothing inferable) — and
`apostrophe.md` §5 names both explicitly as surviving, unedited, to the rule's own second-run
argument. So only a *subset* of the U+0027s `quotes` leaves unmatched are ever actually converted.

Every other capability test in this section reads *class* membership, which is unaffected by
that substitution regardless of whether it happens (Lemma A, §5) — but V1, uniquely, compares
*code points*, because that is its job: telling `""` from `"'`. A literal comparison is therefore
the one place a U+0027 neighbour's *eventual* fate matters, and `quotes` cannot know that fate
from inside its own pass: whether a given U+0027 reaches `apostrophe` at all — as opposed to
being claimed by `quotes` itself and rendered as a quote glyph — and what its *own* neighbours
will read once `quotes` has finished rendering the whole accepted set, are exactly the outputs
this rule is still computing when V1 runs. Deciding V1 exactly would mean re-deriving
`apostrophe`'s verdict against `quotes`' own not-yet-final output — a circular second pipeline
inside this rule, not a fix. (A per-position "is this specific U+0027 definitely going to survive
unmatched with these exact neighbours" analysis was considered and rejected for the same reason:
neighbouring accepted pairs can rewrite the very code points that analysis would need to read
first.)

`V1ID` is therefore a **conservative over-approximation**, not an exact rule: it treats *every*
U+0027 as if it might already be, or might become, U+2019, and every U+2019 as if it might be an
unconverted U+0027 — regardless of which of `apostrophe`'s six cases (1, 2, 3, 3a, 4, 5) will actually apply.

**What "one-directional" bounds, precisely — a local claim, not a pipeline-level one.** At a
single V1 comparison, `V1ID` can only ever *add* a veto: it merges two identities that raw
equality would have kept apart, and it never grants `canOpen`/`canClose` to a candidate that
would not otherwise have had one — `V1ID` only ever makes the equality test *stricter*, never
looser. **That local fact does not extend to the rule's global output.** Pass 2 (§3.3, the stack
pairing) and pass 4 (§3.5, the certification gate) both operate over the *whole* candidate list at
once, not candidate-by-candidate: declining one candidate can remove a crossing pair, a nesting
conflict, or a certification instability that was previously the reason a *different, unrelated*
pair failed to certify. An extra local veto can therefore **indirectly** let another pair certify
that previously could not, reassign which glyphs/depth a pair receives, or change what `nbsp`
(order 70) inserts downstream — this is not a hypothetical: **the reported counterexample is
exactly this shape.** On pass 1, `V1ID` declining the crossing `NARROW` pair (`U+2019`
adjacent to the unmatched `U+0027`) is precisely what lets the `WIDE` pair certify instead of
being caught in the same gate rejection that, pre-fix, declined both. Vetoing one candidate
*enabled* a different conversion; "extra decline only" was never literally true of the rule's
output, only of the single comparison `V1ID` changes.

The actual safety argument therefore does **not** rest on a monotonicity claim. It rests on: (1)
a missed pairing is the failure mode this whole spec already treats as safe — "missing a possible
improvement is safer than damaging text" (`PLAN.md` §6.1,
`docs/AUDIT_REMEDIATION_AND_RELEASE_PLAN.md` §3.1) — against the defect `V1ID` closes, a hard
release blocker (an idempotency violation); and (2) **inspection of every output `V1ID` globally
changes within a reproducible bounded sweep**, not an a-priori argument about direction. The "V1ID
empirical audit" section below is that inspection: every changed output in the sweep — declined,
newly enabled, or reassigned — is individually classified, and none is a false positive against
plausible prose. `tests/rules/quotes.test.ts` pins one permanent regression case per distinct
mechanism found: a pure conservative veto (prime-guard and case-5 U+0027 preserved exactly), the
indirect newly-enabled-outer-pair mechanism (the reported counterexample's own shape), a pairing
reassignment, and the `fr`/`fr-CA` downstream `nbsp` consequence — plus a direct test that the
plain U+0027 vs. U+2019 distinction still governs `apostrophe` and the medial veto exactly as
before, unaffected by `V1ID`, which is scoped to V1's own comparison alone.

**Reachability, precisely.** `QUOTEMARK`, V1, and `apostrophe`'s case ladder are defined
identically for every locale, so the *algorithmic* shape (an unmatched U+0027 adjacent to a
`QUOTEMARK` candidate whose glyph is U+2019) is constructible in every locale with a synthetic
string, and `tests/rules/quotes.test.ts` sweeps it across every entry in `KNOWN_LOCALES` for
exactly that reason — that is a claim about the algorithm, not about naturally occurring prose.
Separately, and more narrowly: `en-GB`'s primary `close` and `fi`/`sv`'s secondary pair (both
sides) are U+2019 *as that locale's own prescribed glyph* — not merely a candidate a foreign or
adversarial input could contain — so those three locales are where an author's ordinary,
correctly-typed document (one already-closed quotation immediately followed by, say, a
possessive apostrophe with no separating space) is the most plausible route to this shape without
any copy-pasted or malformed input at all. `de-CH`, where the defect was first found, reaches it
only via a mixed straight/curly input (`spec/fixtures/de-CH.json`,
`de-ch-quotes-041-cobug-apostrophe-v1`) — de-CH's own glyphs are `« »`/`‹ ›`, neither of which is
U+2019, so the witness there is adversarial, not a natural-content route.

**V1ID empirical audit.** `quotes.ts`'s V1 block was twice temporarily reverted to the pre-0.4.1
raw comparison, run against a bounded, deterministic alphabet across every locale in
`spec/locales/registry.json`, and restored — a controlled experiment, not a committed second
engine, and not itself part of this repository (the exact reversion is exactly the diff `git
diff` shows against `tests/rules/quotes.test.ts`'s permanent assertions, which is what actually
pins the result). Exact counts from that run are deliberately **not** recorded here: an
uncommitted, one-off harness is not something a future maintainer can re-run from this document
alone, and this spec's normative claims must not depend on an experiment nobody can reproduce.
What is recorded, and *is* reproducible — by running `npx vitest run tests/rules/quotes.test.ts`
against `main` — is the durable conclusion the audit reached:

- Every output `V1ID` changes relative to the raw comparison, across the swept alphabet and every
  locale, falls into exactly one of four mechanisms: a pure extra conservative veto (the mark
  stays exactly as authored); an *indirect* newly-enabled conversion (vetoing one candidate
  removes a crossing/certification conflict and lets a different, unrelated pair certify — the
  reported counterexample's own shape, run in general); a pairing reassignment (the same input
  pairs differently, not more or less); and the `fr`/`fr-CA` downstream `nbsp` consequence of a
  differently accepted or declined pair. No difference in the swept range was unexplained.
- Every newly-enabled or reassigned output in the swept range was inspected against ordinary-prose
  plausibility, not merely checked for a digit adjacency. None resembles content a human author
  would write and reject: the newly-enabled class never contains a letter or digit at all (its
  witnesses are runs of quote-class punctuation with no word between them, not prose); the
  reassignment class only ever chooses between two already-plausible readings of a short ambiguous
  fragment (e.g. an ordinary quotation vs. two independent elisions), never invents a reading with
  no textual basis.
- A separate, narrower sweep confirmed the raw-comparison variant is genuinely non-idempotent
  within a bound that reaches the reported defect's minimal witness shape, and that `V1ID` is not,
  across every locale — the direct measurement of the closure this fix provides, not merely of its
  conservative cost.

`tests/rules/quotes.test.ts`'s "V1ID" describe block pins one permanent, exact-output regression
case for each of the four mechanisms above (plus the U+0027/U+2019-still-matters-outside-V1
control) — that is the reproducible evidence this section rests on.

**The second clause is not in either design document that fed this revision, and closes a
composition-obligation violation found only by running the implementation.** A literal-only V1
lets the certification gate correctly decline a pairing when rendering it would place two
identical glyphs strictly adjacent (e.g. `«` immediately left of a mark the gate would render to
`«`) — but if `nbsp` (a *later* rule) subsequently inserts a space at exactly that gap, on the
*next* full-pipeline pass `quotes` sees the two occurrences with a space between them, the
literal adjacency is gone, and the *same* pairing certifies. That is `nbsp` creating work for an
earlier-ordered rule, forbidden by `pipeline-idempotency.md` §2's composition obligation, and it
reproduces with two witnesses, pinned in `spec/fixtures/fr.json` as `fr-quotes-030-cobug-html-tag-boundary`
(`«"<p class="x">"` in `html` mode) and `fr-quotes-030-cobug-double-open-then-closer` (`««”` in
`text` mode). The fix reads the
skip in exactly the two positions Lemma B (§5) already names as `nbsp`'s whole insertion
surface next to a quote mark — a candidate's own `g` value is shared identically with the
same-glyph neighbour a skip reaches, so checking `g`'s own `SPACE-RIGHT`/`SPACE-LEFT` membership
covers both of Lemma B's insertion sites at once, regardless of which of the two occurrences is
on which side of the gap. **A plain skip-based V1** (comparing `Lskip`/`Rskip` to `g`
unconditionally, with no `gapInsertable` guard) **was tried and rejected**: it also vetoes two
genuinely distinct, space-separated quotations (`'a' 'b'`, ordinary prose, not a typewriter
artefact) in every locale, including ones with no spaced pair at all — the guard is what keeps
the veto scoped to positions `nbsp` can actually reach.

Under mandate 1 the veto is **no longer permanent** — a converted mark can acquire or lose an
identical neighbour between runs — and that is stated rather than papered over: **the gate
(§3.5), not this veto, is the guarantor of stability against `quotes`' own re-derivation.** The
`gapInsertable` clause is what extends that guarantee to survive `nbsp` acting *between*
pipeline passes, which the gate alone — being a property of a single call — cannot see.

Record `{ index, width ∈ {WIDE, NARROW}, canOpen, canClose }` for every `i` with at least one
capability true. Candidates with both false are dropped and never touched.

Pass 1 still does **not** decide that a `NARROW` mark with a letter to the right and a space to
the left is a leading elision. It is `canOpen` and enters the pairing; if it finds no partner it
survives and `apostrophe` renders it U+2019. The pairing settles the ambiguity, not a heuristic.

### 3.3 Pass 2 — pair the candidates, one stack per width

**There are two stacks, one for `WIDE` and one for `NARROW`, and a candidate only ever touches
the stack for its own width.** 0.1.0's per-kind split generalised from "the literal code point
`DQ`/`SQ`" to "the glyph's visual width" — the property that actually carried the argument: no
reader opens a quotation with a double mark and closes it with a single one, in any language.
This is what keeps a Greek elision (`σ'`, `NARROW`) from closing a `WIDE` opener.

Walk the candidate list in index order. For candidate `c`, let `S` be the stack for `c.width`:

1. If `c.canClose`, `S` is non-empty, and **`¬vacuous(top(S).index, c.index)`** → pop `o`, record
   the pair `(o.index, c.index)`.
2. Else if `c.canOpen` → push `c` onto `S`.
3. Else record `c` as unmatched.

When the walk ends, everything still on either stack is unmatched.

> **`vacuous(a, b)`** ⟺ every `cp[k]` with `a < k < b` is in `INLINE-SPACE` (vacuously true when
> `b = a + 1`).

**The vacuity condition is new and is forced by mandate 1.** In 0.1.0 an empty pair was
impossible: two adjacent marks of the same kind were vetoed by V1, and two of different kinds
were on different stacks. Now `«»` is two *different* code points of the *same* width, and `" "`
is two identical marks V1 cannot see past a space; both would enclose no content. The condition
sits in step 1 rather than as a fourth outcome: a closer that fails step 1 **falls through to
step 2 and then step 3**, so every candidate still reaches exactly one of three outcomes and the
accepted/unmatched partition stays exhaustive — that exhaustiveness is what makes the "declined"
set well-defined for the gate. **Do not add a fourth outcome to this list.**

Step 1 before step 2 — **closing takes precedence** — is retained unchanged. An `«` whose
right-hand space `nbsp` inserted reads `closeRight = Rskip`, exactly as it did before `nbsp`
touched it, so the tie-break's ambiguity does not shift under mandate 1.

### 3.4 Pass 3 — assign glyphs by depth

For a set of pairs `A`, the **depth** of `p ∈ A` is

> `depth_A(p) = 1 + |{ q ∈ A : q.open < p.open ∧ p.close < q.close }|`

— one plus the number of *accepted* pairs that strictly enclose it. Odd depth → `quotes.primary`;
even depth → `quotes.secondary`. Depths beyond 2 alternate by the same parity.

**Depth is computed over the accepted set `A`, not over the raw pass-2 output.** On a second run
the accepted set *is* the raw set, so a depth taken over the raw set on run 1 and over the
accepted set on run 2 would disagree whenever the gate declined anything. Depth over `A` agrees
on both runs by construction.

**Depth, not the mark's original width, selects the pair.** `'He said "no" to me,' she noted.`
promotes the outer `NARROW` marks to `en-US`'s `WIDE` primary pair and demotes the inner ones —
the reason width drift exists at all, and the case the certification gate exists to re-verify.

### 3.5 Pass 4 — the certification gate

This pass replaces 0.1.0's Claims 1–3. It is a *check the algorithm performs*, not a property a
reader must verify by argument alone.

**Rendering.** `render(cp, A)` is the array obtained by applying, for every `p ∈ A` with assigned
pair `P = pairFor(depth_A(p))`:

- replace `cp[p.open]` with `P.open` and `cp[p.close]` with `P.close`;
- **if and only if `P.innerSpace = "none"`**, delete the pair's two *inner runs* where the
  landing guard permits:
  - the **open-side run** = the maximal `INLINE-SPACE` run starting at `p.open + 1` (possibly
    empty); its **landing** is the first code point past it;
  - the **close-side run** = the maximal `INLINE-SPACE` run ending at `p.close - 1`; its landing
    is the first code point before it;
  - a run is deleted iff it is non-empty, its landing is in `DELETE-LANDING`, and it is not
    simultaneously both of the pair's runs (a pair enclosing nothing but spaces deletes
    neither — unreachable for an accepted pair given §3.3's vacuity condition, but stated because
    the construction is otherwise silent about it).

`render` also yields the order-preserving index map `π` from surviving input indices to output
indices.

**Certification loop.**

```
A := the pair set from pass 2
loop:
    if A = ∅:                                   accept ∅ and stop
    (y, π) := render(cp, A)
    B := passes 1–2 applied to y                (raw, ungated)
    if { (π(p.open), π(p.close)) : p ∈ A } = B: accept A and stop
    A' := { p ∈ A : (π(p.open), π(p.close)) ∈ B }
    if A' = A:  A := A \ { the pair of A with the greatest `open` index }
    else:       A := A'
```

**Every clause is normative, including the tie-break.** When the intersection fails to shrink
`A` — exactly when `B ⊋ π(A)`, i.e. the rendered array admits a pairing the input did not — one
pair is removed, and *which* pair is specified so two ports cannot disagree.

**Termination.** Each iteration either accepts or strictly shrinks `A`. `A` is finite and `∅`
accepts unconditionally, so the loop runs at most `|A₀| + 1` times. Cost is `O(k·n)` with `k` the
number of pairs; in the overwhelmingly common case the first round certifies and the extra cost
is one `O(n)` pass. An implementation may short-circuit on that.

**Why the exit condition is `B = π(A)` and not `π(A) ⊆ B`.** Exiting with extra pairs in `B` is
unsound: the second run *starts* from `B`, and if `B` certifies, the second run renders `B`'s
extra pairs and the output differs. The intersection alone does not terminate at a sound state,
which is why the forced-removal clause exists.

**Empirical status of the forced-removal clause.** An exhaustive sweep of ~850,000 inputs across
all ten locales (the alphabet of §9's fixtures, to length 4–5, plus the named witnesses) did not
observe the clause firing even once — every case that reached the gate either certified in round
1 or was resolved by the plain intersection shrinking `A`. The clause is implemented as specified
(it is strictly more conservative than omitting it, never less sound, so it costs nothing even if
unreachable in practice) but its necessity is **not** demonstrated by a concrete witness as of
this writing. If a future sweep finds one, it belongs in `spec/fixtures/` as a named case.

### 3.6 Pass 5 — emit

For each `p` in the accepted set:

- an edit replacing `cp[p.open]` with the assigned `open` glyph, **omitted if the code point is
  already that glyph**;
- likewise at `p.close`;
- a deletion edit for each inner run the landing guard permitted, **omitted if the run is
  empty**.

An edit whose replacement is identical to the span it replaces is never emitted — the
invisible-edit principle `dashes.md` §3.3.1 states for the joiner, applied so that
already-correct text produces a byte-identical no-op rather than a diff of self-replacements.
Suppression is per **mark**, not per pair: a pair where only one side needed a glyph change
emits exactly one glyph edit.

Emitted spans are pairwise disjoint: replacements sit at distinct mark indices; a deletion span
lies strictly between a mark and its landing; and since accepted pairs are properly nested or
disjoint (stack discipline) and a pair enclosing only spaces deletes neither run, no two spans
can claim the same index. Edits are sorted ascending before returning.

Unmatched candidates and declined pairs produce no edit and keep their code point exactly.

### 3.7 `innerSpace`: `quotes` deletes, `nbsp` inserts

The split is asymmetric on purpose.

- `innerSpace = "none"` — a space inside the pair is *wrong* and nobody else can remove it.
  `nbsp` has no deletion capability at all. `quotes` deletes it, subject to the landing guard.
- `innerSpace ≠ "none"` — a space inside the pair is *required*, and `nbsp` (order 70) already
  inserts and converts it, correctly and idempotently, at `nbsp.md` §3.10. `quotes` emits
  nothing and deletes nothing there.

So `quotes` still never inserts a space, `nbsp` keeps ownership of all no-break spacing, and
there is no second copy of anyone's rules. `"mot"` → `«mot»` → (via `nbsp`) `«` U+00A0 `mot`
U+00A0 `»` — U+00A0 because `fr`'s primary pair sets `innerSpace: "nbsp"`, and **no shipped
locale sets `"narrow-nbsp"`** (nbsp.md §3.1a); this read U+202F until spec 1.3.0, which is a
claim about a locale file that the file never supported. `« mot »` → (no edit from `quotes`) →
the same output via `nbsp`. Both paths
converge, which is the property the pipeline needs.

**The landing guard is not a heuristic; it is a structural CO discharge.** The deleted run's near
side is a quote glyph and its far side is in `ALNUM ∪ QUOTEMARK`. Every class the four
earlier-ordered rules read as evidence — `spaces`' `CONTENT`/`STRIP-BEFORE`/bracket sets,
`ellipsis`' dot runs, `dashes`' `DASH`, `INERT-DASH`, `DIGIT`, `SPACE ∪ NOBREAK-SPACE`, `LETTER`,
`ROMAN`, `hyphen`'s `WORDISH` — classifies a quote glyph and a U+0020 **identically** (both
outside all of them, except `SPACE`, which the guard's own construction keeps away from any dash
run). `ALNUM ∪ QUOTEMARK` is the largest landing class for which that holds; letting the
deletion land on a dash is what would produce `" --x"` → `“--x”` → `“—x”`, a violation of `I₃`.
Two absolutes fall out of the same construction: **a `BREAK` is never deleted** (not in
`INLINE-SPACE`, so it terminates the run and, being outside `DELETE-LANDING`, declines the
deletion) and **`MARKER` is never crossed** (same mechanism), so the span partition is stable
between runs as `modes.md` §5 requires.

## 4. Must not touch

Each bullet is **[P]** (a guarantee of `transform`) or **[R]** (true of this rule alone, with the
rule that can falsify it named), per `pipeline-idempotency.md` §5.2.

- **[P] A medial apostrophe:** `don't`, `l'été`, `O'Brien`, `Hawai'i`, `1990's` — and their
  U+2019 forms on a second pass. Vetoed in §3.2.
- **[P] A possessive or elision written flush against an inline span boundary** (spec 1.4.0):
  `` `x`'s ``, `<code>x</code>'s`, `*x*'s`, `l'<em>idée</em>` — where the attaching fragment is a
  cited `quotes.elisionClitics` entry. Vetoed in §3.2's span-boundary elision veto and converted
  by `apostrophe`. **[P]** rather than **[R]** because the guarantee is the joint outcome of two
  rules: this one declines to pair, `apostrophe` (order 50) emits the U+2019.
- **[R] A leading elision that finds no partner** (`'90s`, `'tis`) and **[R] a trailing
  possessive that finds no partner** (`the dogs' bowls`). Handed to `apostrophe`.
- **[R] A foot or inch mark:** `6' 2"`. Both marks are `canClose` only with an empty stack. The
  0.1.0 caveat still applies verbatim: in `"6' 2"` the foot mark pairs, and the protection is not
  pipeline-level.
- **[P] Any unbalanced mark.** Convert what is unambiguous, leave the rest — §3.6 of 0.1.0's
  policy is unchanged.
- **[P] Any run of two or more identical quote marks:** `""`, `'''`, `««`, `””`. V1.
- **[P] A pair enclosing nothing but spaces:** `«»`, `" "`, `” ”`. §3.3's vacuity condition.
- **[P] U+2032, U+2033, U+02BC, U+0060, U+00B4** and the LaTeX idioms `` ` `` and `''`. Not in
  `QUOTEMARK`.
- **[P] Anything inside a skipped region.** Attribute values, code spans, fenced code, `<pre>`,
  URLs — removed by the mode adapter.
- **[P] Line terminators.** Never deleted, never crossed by a skip walk.
- **[R] Outer spacing.** This rule deletes only *inner* spacing and inserts nothing.

**No longer on this list, by operator decision:** every non-straight quotation glyph. `“ ” « »
„ ‘ ’ ‚ ‹ ›` and the rest are now candidates. `en-GB` text containing a correct `“…”` pair will
be rewritten to `‘…’`; `de-DE` text containing `«Wort»` becomes `„Wort“`. That is mandate 1, and
it is the largest behavioural change in this revision.

**Known, accepted residual risk — not new under this revision.** A leading elision that has
already been curled to U+2019 (`’90s were fun,’ he said`) can, if a later unrelated closing mark
exists on the same stack, be paired as an opener and lose its elided-digit reading. This was
already possible for straight input under 0.1.0 (`'90s were fun,' he said` is corrupted
identically) — it is §7 item 3's family, "no local way to distinguish an elision from a real
opening quote", now also reachable via curly input because mandate 1 makes curly input a
candidate at all. **§7 item 8's `quotes.elisionIdioms` (spec 0.4.0) does not cover this case**:
that veto fires only on a listed idiom's full left/elided/right context found together, not on
a lone elision separated from any partner by arbitrary distance. It is **not** a new defect this
revision introduces; §5's Corollary A1 explains why no U+2019-specific restriction is applied, and
`spec/fixtures/` pins the verified behaviour across `en-GB`, `en-US`, `fi` and `sv` (§6, rows
E1–E4) so the tradeoff is a citable fact rather than an assumption.

**The same family, reachable through a span boundary, and likewise not closed (spec 1.4.0).** A
*plural* possessive after a span — `` `xs`' printer `` — is byte-identical to a quotation's
closing mark after a span, so §3.2's span-boundary elision veto cannot reach it and no test over
those neighbours could: its attaching fragment is empty on both sides. It stays a `canClose`
candidate able to close a mark arbitrarily far away, which is item 3's non-locality with a span
boundary standing in for the elision. §3.2 carries the measured five-line witness.

---

## 5. Idempotency argument

0.1.0's Claims 1 and 2 are **withdrawn**, not weakened. Claim 1 ("a converted position is not a
candidate on the second run") is false by construction under mandate 1, and with it goes the
permanence of V1: two marks that were distinct can both be assigned the same glyph, so the
veto's verdict is no longer immutable. Claim 2's monotonicity is likewise gone: a converted mark
can *gain* a capability. Claim 3 rested on both. Three replacements follow.

### Lemma A — glyph-blindness

> Replacing any `QUOTEMARK` at index `j` with any other `QUOTEMARK` changes no capability of any
> candidate at any index `i ≠ j`.

*Proof.* A candidate's four neighbour reads are compared against `NONE`, `SPACELIKE`, `OPENISH`,
`CLOSEISH`, `DASHISH`, `QUOTEMARK`, `MARKER`, `ALNUM` (the medial veto) and `LETTER` (the
span-boundary veto's run walk, spec 1.4.0), and V1 compares `V1ID` of the relevant code points
against `V1ID(g)` (spec 0.4.1). Every `QUOTEMARK` is in `OPENISH`, in `CLOSEISH`, in
`QUOTEMARK`, in none of `SPACELIKE`, `DASHISH`, `ALNUM`, `LETTER`, and is neither `MARKER` nor
`NONE`. All eight class tests are therefore **invariant**, not merely monotone. The skip walks
are invariant because `QUOTEMARK ∩ INLINE-SPACE = ∅`, and the span-boundary veto's `LETTER` runs
are invariant for the same reason — no quote glyph is a `LETTER`, so substituting one can neither
extend nor truncate a run, nor change the `outer ∉ ALNUM` test that bounds it.

**V1 is invariant too, as of spec 0.4.1, and this required changing V1 itself, not just arguing
about it.** Before 0.4.1, V1 compared raw code points, and replacing a neighbour's `U+0027` with
`U+2019` — the one substitution this lemma's hypothesis is actually exercised against by
`apostrophe`, via Corollary A1 below — could change whether that neighbour's code point equalled
a candidate's own `g`, which is exactly the comparison V1 makes. That was a real gap, not a
theorem this document previously proved: the claim once made here — that "V1's movement is
precisely what the gate certifies" — conflated two different sources of movement. The
certification gate (§3.5) re-derives candidates from `quotes`' *own* hypothetical render, within
one call; it has no visibility into a *different* rule editing the input between two separate
pipeline invocations, which is exactly what `apostrophe` does. §3.2's `V1ID` closes the actual
gap: `V1ID(U+0027) = V1ID(U+2019) = U+2019`, and `V1ID` is the identity elsewhere, so replacing a
`U+0027` neighbour with `U+2019` (or vice versa) changes neither side of any V1 comparison in
`V1ID`-space. V1's verdict is now invariant under Lemma A's hypothesis by the same construction
as the other seven tests, not by appeal to a mechanism (the gate) that cannot see the edit in
question. ∎

**The listed elision veto (spec 0.4.0) is covered by the same argument, not a new proof
obligation.** Every input it reads is one Lemma A already accounts for or one nothing in this
pipeline ever touches:

- `NARROW` membership of `cp[i]` and `cp[j]` — invariant, same as every test above.
- The elided content `cp[i+1 … i+k]` — a literal `LETTER` run (in the shipped `en-US` entry;
  the schema permits any non-empty string, but an idiom's `elided` field is authored as
  letters). `apostrophe` (R₆) never touches a `LETTER`; it replaces exactly one `SQ` with
  exactly one U+2019 and nothing else (`apostrophe.md` §1). Unaffected by any rule ordered at
  or before `quotes` for the same reason.
- The single `INLINE-SPACE` code point on each outer side, and the `left`/`right` `LETTER` runs
  beyond it — `apostrophe` touches neither an `INLINE-SPACE` code point nor a `LETTER`; nothing
  ordered before `quotes` does either (each earlier rule's own §4 "Must not touch" already
  states this for ordinary prose letters and spacing it did not itself just emit, and none of
  them emits a `LETTER`).

So substituting `g`'s own U+0027 for U+2019 at `i` or `j` (the only edit `apostrophe` can make
to this construction, and the only one reachable in this direction) changes none of the four
inputs above, and the veto's verdict on a given pair of indices is invariant under Lemma A's
hypothesis exactly as every other capability test is. Concretely: on the pipeline's second
pass, `rock ’n’ roll`'s two marks are U+2019 rather than U+0027, still `NARROW`, still bounded
by the identical literal `rock`/`n`/`roll` context — the veto fires identically, both marks are
vetoed again, `quotes` makes no pairing, and `apostrophe` does not act on U+2019 at all (§4).
The construction is a fixed point (§6 row P4 pins it).

**Modes.** `text` is the base case above — and for the span-boundary veto that base case is
vacuous, since `text` produces no marker at all and neither of its two tests can fire there. For
`yaml` see §3.2: the veto is marker-triggered rather than mode-triggered, so it needs no separate
argument and must not be given a mode conditional. In `html` and `markdown`, `modes.md` §3.2's
concatenation-with-marker model means the veto's bounded lookaround can land on a `MARKER` (a
negative integer, in none of `LETTER`, `INLINE-SPACE`, `NARROW`) exactly where a real code
point would otherwise be — a context word split from its mark by an element or span boundary
fails the `INLINE-SPACE` test at that position and the veto does not fire (§6 rows H1–H3). This
is not a special case for modes: it is the same "word not found" outcome an ordinary document
boundary produces (`Llit`/`Rlit` = `NONE`), and `modes.md` §5's stability argument — no rule may
emit a code point at a position that changes how the next pass partitions spans — is
unaffected, because this veto neither emits anything nor changes any span boundary; it only
narrows which pairs `quotes` itself forms, which `modes.md` §5 part 3 already covers for the
rest of this rule's determinism.

### Lemma B — space-inertness at every position `nbsp` can reach

> Inserting a code point of `INLINE-SPACE`, or converting one `INLINE-SPACE` code point to
> another, at any position `nbsp` can act on, changes no capability of any candidate.

*Proof.* Conversion is trivial: every test reads class membership and U+0020, U+00A0, U+202F are
all in `INLINE-SPACE`. For insertion, `nbsp` has exactly three insertion sites (`nbsp.ts`
`claimInsertion`):

1. **N8, immediately right of an occurrence of `g ∈ SPACE-RIGHT`.**
   - *`g` itself*: `canOpen` reads `Rskip` (skips) and `openLeft` (untouched); `canClose` reads
     `Lskip` (untouched) and `closeRight`, which is `Rskip` because `g ∈ SPACE-RIGHT` (skips).
     All four invariant.
   - *the candidate `c` whose `Llit` was `g`*: `c.canOpen` reads `openLeft`, which is `Llit`
     (unless `c ∈ SPACE-LEFT`, in which case it skips): `g ∈ OPENISH` is accepted,
     `INLINE-SPACE ⊂ SPACELIKE` is accepted — same verdict. `c.canClose` reads `Lskip`, which
     skips the insertion back to `g` — same. Right-hand reads untouched.
   - no other index has a changed neighbourhood.
2. **N8, immediately left of `h ∈ SPACE-LEFT`.** Mirror image: `h.canOpen` reads
   `openLeft = Lskip` (skips, because `h ∈ SPACE-LEFT`); `h.canClose` reads `Lskip`. The
   candidate whose `Rlit` was `h` reads `closeRight = Rlit`, moving from `h ∈ CLOSEISH`
   (accepted) to `INLINE-SPACE` (accepted) — same verdict; and `Rskip`, which skips back to `h`.
3. **N1/N2, immediately left of a mark `m ∈ nbsp.beforePunctuation ∪
   nbsp.narrowBeforePunctuation`.** The only quote mark whose neighbourhood changes is a `g`
   with `Rlit = m`. Its `closeRight` moves from `m` to `INLINE-SPACE`; by constraint **Q-P**,
   `m ∈ CLOSEISH`, so both are accepted — same verdict. Its `Rskip` skips back to `m`. (`nbsp`'s
   own step 3 already declines to insert after an opening glyph.)

No other sub-rule inserts; N3–N7, N9, N10 only convert. ∎

**V1's `gapInsertable` clause (§3.2) is what extends this proof to V1 itself.** The four
capability tests above are the ones Lemma B's statement covers directly, but V1 is also a test a
candidate's own capabilities depend on, and it compares *code points*, not class membership —
Lemma B's "accepts `SPACELIKE` either way" argument does not apply to it. `gapInsertable` is
defined to hold exactly when `g` is a member of `SPACE-RIGHT` or `SPACE-LEFT` — precisely the
condition under which `nbsp`'s insertion sites 1 and 2 above can place a code point at the one
gap V1's second clause reads across — so V1's verdict is invariant to that insertion by the same
argument, case by case: at insertion site 1, the candidate immediately right of `g' ∈ SPACE-RIGHT`
has `gapInsertable = true` when its own glyph equals `g'` (the only case V1's second clause can
ever fire for it), and the literal-vs-skipped reads agree on whether that neighbour is `g'`,
exactly as case 1 above already shows for `canOpen`/`canClose`. Insertion site 2 is the mirror
image for `SPACE-LEFT`. Insertion site 3 (N1/N2) never inserts adjacent to a `QUOTEMARK` glyph on
the side V1 reads (it inserts beside listed punctuation, never beside a quote mark's own
same-glyph neighbour), so it cannot affect `gapInsertable`'s condition at all.

> **Corollary B1.** A run-1/run-2 asymmetry that used to arise from `quotes` reading a
> `SPACE-RIGHT` glyph's right side literally on one run and skipping it on the other cannot arise
> under §3.2: the read is `Rskip` on **both** runs, so `« **"` pairs on the first application and
> re-pairs identically on the second.

### Certification — the theorem

> **Theorem.** For every input `x` and every locale, `Q(Q(x)) = Q(x)`.

*Proof.* Let `A` be the accepted set and `y = Q(x) = render(x, A)`.

**Case `A = ∅`.** Then `y = x`. `Q` is a deterministic function of its input and the locale, with
no state (`ARCHITECTURE.md` §7), so `Q(y) = Q(x) = x = y`. ∎

**Case `A ≠ ∅`.** The loop exited on the equality branch, so `G₀(y) = π(A)`, where `G₀` denotes
passes 1–2. Run `Q` on `y`. Passes 1–2 give `A₀' = G₀(y) = π(A)`. The gate's first round computes
`render(y, π(A))`, and this equals `y`:

- **Glyphs.** `π` is order-preserving, so `depth_{π(A)}(π(p)) = depth_A(p)` for every `p`; the
  assigned pair is the same, and `y` already carries those glyphs at those indices by
  construction of `render`.
- **Inner spacing.** For a pair whose `innerSpace ≠ "none"`, `render` never touches spacing, on
  either run. For `innerSpace = "none"`: a run that was deleted is gone, so there is nothing to
  delete; a run that was declined is still present and its landing is unchanged — `render` maps
  `QUOTEMARK` to `QUOTEMARK` and leaves `ALNUM` alone, so a landing outside `DELETE-LANDING`
  stays outside it, and the same run is declined again.

Therefore `G₀(render(y, π(A))) = G₀(y) = π(A)`, the gate certifies in round 1, and
`Q(y) = render(y, π(A)) = y`. ∎

### Composition obligation

This rule is **R₅**; the obligation runs against `spaces`, `ellipsis`, `dashes` and `hyphen`, and
its own `I₅` must survive `apostrophe`, `symbols` and `nbsp`.

**What this rule emits.** `E(quotes)` = the four locale quote glyphs, each replacing exactly one
`QUOTEMARK` at the same index. Plus deletions of a maximal `INLINE-SPACE` run whose near side is
a quote glyph and whose far side is in `ALNUM ∪ QUOTEMARK`. **Nothing is inserted.**

**The listed elision veto (spec 0.4.0) changes none of the below.** It adds no emission — a
vetoed pair of marks is simply never paired, so `E(quotes)` is exactly what it was — and can
only shrink the set of pairs this rule forms, never grow it. Every discharge that follows was
argued against a `quotes` whose positive behaviour is a superset of the current one, so each
still holds without re-verification.

- **Against `I₁` (`spaces`).** Discharged. No U+0020 is emitted, so no S-b/S-c/S-d position can
  be created. Deletion removes a *maximal* run, so it cannot bring two U+0020 into contact
  (S-a); its neighbours after deletion are a quote glyph and an `ALNUM`/`QUOTEMARK`, both
  `CONTENT`.
- **Against `I₂` (`ellipsis`).** Discharged. No U+002E or U+2026 is emitted; the deletion's
  landing is in `ALNUM ∪ QUOTEMARK`, which contains no dot, so no two dot runs are joined.
- **Against `I₃` (`dashes`).** Discharged **structurally**. A quote glyph is in none of `DASH`,
  `INERT-DASH`, `DIGIT`, `SPACE`, `NOBREAK-SPACE`, `JOINER`, `ROMAN` or `LETTER`, so a
  `cp[L]`/`cp[R]`/`before`/`after` moving from one quote mark to another moves nowhere. The
  deletion's two sides are a quote glyph and a `DELETE-LANDING` member, **neither in
  `DASH ∪ INERT-DASH`** — so no dash run is ever adjacent to a deleted run, no token's
  `lsp`/`rsp` changes, and the landing separates the deletion from any dash run by at least one
  code point. This is the discharge the naive "delete the inner space unconditionally"
  formulation failed, with witness `" --x"` → `“--x”` → `“—x”` (row D1, §6).
- **Against `I₄` (`hyphen`).** Discharged. `hyphen`'s boundary test is `¬WORDISH`, and both a
  U+0020 and a quote glyph are outside `WORDISH = ALNUM ∪ HYPHENISH`. The deletion never lands
  inside a word, only against its first or last code point.
- **`I₅` against `apostrophe` (R₆).** Discharged by Corollary A1 (CO-S).
- **`I₅` against `nbsp` (R₈).** Discharged by Lemma B (CO-S-shaped, over `nbsp`'s insertion
  *sites* rather than its emission alphabet alone — the alphabet by itself is not enough, because
  a `SPACELIKE` insertion is *not* inert at an arbitrary position; it is inert at exactly the
  positions `nbsp` can reach).
- **`I₅` against `symbols` (R₇).** **Known-weak: a case analysis, not CO-S.** `symbols`
  collapses `(c)`/`(r)`/`(tm)` to a single sign, deleting code points, and converts `x` to `×`
  between numerals. A quote mark adjacent to a collapsed span sees `(` on its right (moving to
  `©`, which is neither `OPENISH` nor `CLOSEISH`) or `)` on its left (moving to `©`). Checked
  over all four capability tests, every reachable verdict coincides: `canOpen`'s right test
  accepts `(` and accepts `©`; `canClose`'s right test rejects both; `canOpen`'s left test
  rejects `)` and rejects `©`; `canClose`'s left test accepts both as non-`NONE`. This is not
  made structural — the sweep is the control, per §5.1a of `pipeline-idempotency.md`.

## 6. Worked examples

`␣` = U+0020, `⍽` = U+00A0, `⟶` = no change. Every row is verified by running
`src/rules/quotes.ts` against the fixture of the same name in `spec/fixtures/`; none is
hand-traced-only.

#### Listed elision veto — `en-US`, `elisionIdioms = [{ left: "rock", elided: "n", right: "roll" }]`

Positive — the full context matches and both marks are vetoed, so `apostrophe` (order 50) renders
each independently:

| # | Input | Output | Why |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| P1 | `rock 'n' roll` | `rock ’n’ roll` | canonical form |
| P2 | `Rock 'n' roll is great.` | `Rock ’n’ roll is great.` | sentence-initial capital — first-code-point leniency on `left` |
| P3 | `I love rock 'n' roll.` | `I love rock ’n’ roll.` | trailing period after `right` does not block the word-boundary test |
| P4 | `rock ’n’ roll` | ⟶ | already-curly: U+2019 is `NARROW`, the veto fires identically on the already-correct form, `apostrophe` does not act on U+2019 at all — a fixed point (§5) |

Negative **for the listed mechanism only** — the elided content matches but the full
`left`/`elided`/`right` context does not, so no configured idiom fires. Since spec 1.1.0 every row
below is nevertheless matched by the universal medial-`n` veto (§3.2), so every one converts, and
this table's job is to show where the two mechanisms differ rather than where the marks fall
through. N1 and N2 remain the rows that matter most: they were reported as falsely elided by the
earlier, context-free `elisionForms` design, and 1.1.0 accepts that specific cost knowingly and
narrowly (§3.2, "Accepted false positive") — which is not the same as readmitting the unbounded
word list that was rejected.

**These five outputs were last accurate before spec 0.5.0.** The table was not updated when 0.5.0's
veto landed, so as written it described neither 0.5.0's behaviour nor the fixtures'; the outputs
below are 1.1.0's, verified against `spec/fixtures/en-US.json`.

| # | Input | Output | Why |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| N1 | `The letter 'n' is common.` | `The letter ’n’ is common.` | no `left`/`right` context at all, so no idiom fires — but the universal veto matches the bare `'n'` and `apostrophe` converts both marks. The accepted false positive of §3.2, stated there in full |
| N2 | `He said "press 'n' now".` | `He said “press ’n’ now”.` | the same shape one level deeper; §3.2's predicate reads a mark's immediate neighbours and knows nothing of enclosing pairs, so nesting depth never reaches it |
| N3 | `rock 'n' pop` | `rock ’n’ pop` | `right` is `pop`, not `roll` — no configured idiom matches, and since 1.1.0 none is needed |
| N4 | `fish 'n' chips` | `fish ’n’ chips` | not sourced or listed: no `{ left: "fish", … }` entry exists in `en-US.json`, and none is required for the marks to convert |
| N5 | `rock 'N' roll` | `rock ’N’ roll` | `elided` is matched **exactly** by the listed mechanism, so `N ≠ n` still fails *it*; the universal veto matches U+004E as well as U+006E, and converts both marks |

**Known, accepted residual ambiguity (not a negative-fixture guarantee).** The full-context
requirement narrows the false-positive surface to genuine surface-form coincidence; it cannot
see authorial intent, only code points. A document that explicitly states it means three
separate tokens — a word, a genuinely quoted single letter, another word — and then reproduces
the identical surface sequence for illustration still gets that final occurrence vetoed:

| # | Input | Output | Why |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| N6 | `The sequence is the word rock, the quoted letter 'n', and the word roll: rock 'n' roll.` | `The sequence is the word rock, the quoted letter “n”, and the word roll: rock ’n’ roll.` | **the first `'n'` is correctly NOT vetoed**, and by both mechanisms independently: the mark closing it is followed by a comma rather than an `INLINE-SPACE`, which fails the universal veto's outer test (§3.2), and `left` is `letter` rather than `rock`, which fails the listed idiom's. It pairs as an ordinary quotation. **The second `rock 'n' roll` IS vetoed and pinned as known, accepted risk, not fixed.** Under the intent the sentence itself states, this is a genuine semantic false positive — accepted as an unavoidable one for this bounded, surface-form contract, since `left`/`elided`/`right` and the single permitted `INLINE-SPACE` are all it is defined over, and none of them can encode "this is a demonstration, not an utterance of the idiom." The implementation still conforms exactly to its own matcher here: the bytes are the idiom's bytes, byte for byte, and the matcher cannot see past that. Recorded so the exposure is visible in the conformance suite rather than discovered in someone's content (§3.2's residual-ambiguity note) |

#### Elision vetoes across span boundaries — `html`, `markdown`

`modes.md` §3.2's boundary marker is not `INLINE-SPACE`, so a **context word** separated from its
mark by an element or span boundary does not satisfy the listed idiom's outer test, and that idiom
does not fire. The universal medial-`n` veto (§3.2) reads no context word at all — only the single
enclosed code point and the space immediately outside each mark — so a boundary further out is
invisible to it and it fires on all four rows. Since spec 1.1.0 the split cases therefore converge
with the unsplit one instead of diverging from it.

**H1–H3's outputs were last accurate before spec 0.5.0** and are corrected here for the same
reason as N1–N5 above; they are verified against `spec/fixtures/en-US.json`.

| # | Mode | Input | Output | Why |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| H0 | `html` | `<p>rock 'n' roll</p>` | `<p>rock ’n’ roll</p>` | idiom whole within one text node — positive control, both mechanisms match |
| H1 | `html` | `<p><em>rock</em> 'n' roll</p>` | `<p><em>rock</em> ’n’ roll</p>` | `left` word is inside a different span, so the *listed* idiom does not match; the universal veto never looks for a `left` word, and the opening mark's own left neighbour is still a real `INLINE-SPACE` |
| H2 | `html` | `<p>rock 'n' <em>roll</em></p>` | `<p>rock ’n’ <em>roll</em></p>` | mirror case on `right` |
| H3 | `markdown` (`commonmark`) | `*rock* 'n' roll\n` | `*rock* ’n’ roll\n` | `left` word is inside an emphasis span; same reasoning as H1, and the result matches `text` mode on the same characters split the same way |

#### Span-boundary elision veto — `html`, `markdown` (spec 1.4.0)

Every row is measured output, and each is pinned as a conformance fixture; the `Why` column is
what a port should be able to re-derive from §3.2 alone.

| # | Locale | Input | Output | Why |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| S1 | `en-GB` | `` He says 'avoid `x`'s printer.' Done. `` | `` He says ‘avoid `x`’s printer.’ Done. `` | `Llit` is the `MARKER`, the run right of the mark is `s`, and `s` is a cited `after` entry. Vetoed; `apostrophe` case 4 emits U+2019; the author's own pair keeps the primary glyphs. Through 1.3.1 this gave `` ’avoid `x`‘s printer.’ `` |
| S2 | `fr` | `Il dit 'l'<em>idée</em> est bonne.' Fin.` | `Il dit «⍽l’<em>idée</em> est bonne.⍽» Fin.` | the mirror direction: `Rlit` is the `MARKER`, the run left of the mark is `l`, a cited `before` entry. Through 1.3.1 this gave `Il dit «⍽l⍽»<em>idée</em> est bonne.' Fin.` — guillemets around one letter, the real closing mark abandoned |
| S3 | `fr` | `Il dit 'jusqu'<em>ici</em> tout va bien.' Fin.` | `Il dit «⍽jusqu’<em>ici</em> tout va bien.⍽» Fin.` | the run is compared **whole**: it is `jusqu`, so an entry `qu` could not match it. This is why `jusqu`, `lorsqu`, `puisqu` and `quoiqu` are listed in their own right |
| S4 | `fr` | `Il dit <em>'oui'</em> ici.` | `Il dit <em>«⍽oui⍽»</em> ici.` | the negative control the mechanism exists to preserve. `Llit` is the `MARKER` here too — what separates this from S2 is only that `oui` is not a listed fragment |
| S5 | `en-GB` | `` He says 'avoid `xs`' printer.' Done. `` | `` He says ‘avoid `xs`’ printer.' Done. `` | **not closed.** The plural possessive's run is empty, so neither test applies, and these code points are also a closing mark after a span. The second mark takes the pairing, the third is abandoned as U+0027. **Decided behaviour, not a pending fix** — §3.2. §4, §7 item 10, issue #54 |
| S6 | `fr` | `Il dit 'QU'<em>il</em> vienne.' Fin.` | `Il dit «⍽QU⍽»<em>il</em> vienne.' Fin.` | **not closed.** The fold reaches only the run's first code point, and only ASCII `A`–`Z`, so `QU` does not match `qu` and the inversion survives. Same limit as the listed veto's context words |
| S7 | `en-US` | `He said <em>'s'</em> loudly.` | `He said <em>’s’</em> loudly.` | the accepted false positive: a quotation inside a span whose whole content is a listed fragment. Narrower than the medial-`n` veto's own accepted `The letter 'n' is common.`, since it needs the boundary as well |
| S8 | `nl` | `Hij zegt 'ik kom <em>vroeg </em>'s avonds terug.' Klaar.` | `Hij zegt “ik kom <em>vroeg </em>’s avonds terug.” Klaar.` | `'s` is a word-*initial* omission, so its run lies to the mark's right and the entry is an `after` one — the clearest case for reading both lists positionally (§2) |

| 13 | `Il a dit «␣bonjour␣».` | `Il a dit «⍽bonjour⍽».` | mandate 2's second half: the pair *forms on the first application* and produces no edit from `quotes` because the glyphs are already right |
| 3a | `«␣**"` | `«⍽**⍽»` *(after `nbsp`)* | width drift interacting with a run-1 `nbsp` insertion; `quotes` alone certifies the pair with one edit |

### `fr-CA`, `html` mode

| # | Input | Output | Why |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 3b | `"<p class="x">«[t](u)` | ⟶ | the mode adapter splices a `MARKER` between the two text spans; `«`'s `closeRight` reads `Rskip` (because `« ∈ SPACE-RIGHT`) and finds `[`, so it is never `canClose` and no pair forms, on either application |

### `ru` — primary `« »`, secondary `„ “`

| # | Input | Output | Why |

### `el` — primary `« »`, secondary `“ ”` (both `WIDE`)

| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 16 | `"Είπε 'όχι' σε μένα", σημείωσε.` | `«Είπε “όχι” σε μένα», σημείωσε.` | width drift with no gate intervention — evidence the gate's cost is near zero |
| 18 | `Είπε "σ' αυτό το βιβλίο" χθες.` | `Είπε «σ' αυτό το βιβλίο» χθες.` | the elision is `NARROW`, the quotation `WIDE`, different stacks — the elision survives untouched for `apostrophe` to convert on the next rule |

### `de-DE` — primary `„ “`, secondary `‚ ‘`

| # | Input | Output | Why |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| C | `Er sagte «Wort» leise.` | `Er sagte „Wort“ leise.` | foreign guillemets convert |
| C2 | `Er sagte « Wort » leise.` | `Er sagte „Wort“ leise.` | same, plus both inner runs deleted (landings `W` and `t`) |

### Adversarial sweep — `ru`/`el`/`fr`/`fr-CA` (§7 item 9)

These four locales' primary and secondary pairs are **both `WIDE`**, so the width-keyed stack
split does not independently separate a re-scanned primary stream from a re-scanned secondary
stream the way it does for `en-US`/`en-GB`/`fi`/`sv`. An exhaustive sweep over
`{«, », „, “, ", ', a, ␣}` (the locale's own glyphs plus the shared control alphabet) to length 5
— 149,796 inputs across the four locales — found **zero** idempotency failures; the medial and
same-glyph vetoes plus the certification gate together protect already-curly interleaved text in
this family, even without an independent width partition. Recorded as measured, not asserted.

## 7. Open questions, and what could not be closed

Ordered by how much this matters.

1. **Mandate 1's false-positive surface is genuinely larger, and M4 is where it will show.** A
   lone `«` can now pair with a distant `"` (row 3a converts an input 0.1.0 left alone). Any
   document with an odd stray typographic quote — a `»` used as a bullet, a `’` used as a prime,
   a `«` in a citation — can recruit a partner from arbitrarily far away, and unlike a straight
   mark the result is not visibly "unfinished" to a proofreader. This is a **product** risk, not
   an idempotency one; run the M4 corpus against this change specifically before anything else.
2. **The `symbols` (R₇) discharge is a case analysis**, not structural. Frequency: low (needs a
   quote mark literally adjacent to a `(c)`/`(r)`/`(tm)` span), but not closed structurally.
3. **The elision-vs-closer tradeoff (§4, §5 Corollary A1, §6 rows E1–E4) is verified, not
   eliminated.** A leading elision that has already been rendered U+2019 and finds no partner of
   its own can still be recruited as an opener by an unrelated closer elsewhere in the text —
   that is a different mechanism from item 8's closed-idiom case below (`quotes.elisionIdioms`,
   spec 0.4.0) and is **not** closed by it: the veto only fires on a *listed idiom's full
   left/elided/right context* found together, not on a lone leading elision separated from any
   partner by arbitrary distance. No fix is proposed here.
4. **The gate's forced-removal clause's necessity is asserted, not demonstrated with a concrete
   witness.** ~850,000 swept inputs did not trigger it. Implemented anyway (free insurance); if a
   future witness fires it, record it as a fixture.
5. **Declined deletions leave visibly sloppy output** (`" --x"` → `“ --x”`, row D1). This is the
   correct side to be wrong on (the alternative is a confirmed `I₃` violation) but is a real,
   acknowledged gap in mandate 2's coverage.
6. **`" "` and `«»` are prevented by an explicit vacuity guard, not by construction**, unlike
   0.1.0 where an empty pair was structurally impossible. Weaker footing than 0.1.0 had, though
   the gate catches any resulting instability.
7. **Worst case is `O(n²)`** (gate rounds × pass cost). A pathological span of alternating quote
   marks is quadratic; cap rounds if this matters in practice.
8. **`rock 'n' roll` — closed for every locale in spec 1.1.0 by the universal medial-`n` veto
   (§3.2), by operator decision that the idiom is international rather than a locale fact.** It
   was closed for `en-US` alone in spec 0.4.0 via `quotes.elisionIdioms =
   [{ left: "rock", elided: "n", right: "roll" }]` (Chicago Manual of Style Online on the
   mark's function, American Heritage Dictionary on the spaced variant's existence — see
   `en-US.json` `sources`), and that entry is retained and still cited; it now vetoes a strict
   subset of what the universal veto vetoes.
   **What 1.1.0 knowingly accepts in exchange** is the cost that sank a first design during the
   development of 0.4.0 (a bare `elisionForms = ["n"]` word list, matching only the elided
   content, prototyped and rejected before any release or commit — it never shipped and no user
   ever ran it): ordinary quotations of the letter *n* are elided — `The letter 'n' is common.`,
   `He said "press 'n' now".`, §6 rows N1/N2. The reasoning that rejected it in 0.4.0 was not
   wrong; what changed is the alternative it was measured against. In 0.4.0 the alternative was
   `elisionIdioms`' three-part contract, which is strictly better for `en-US`. From 0.5.0 the
   de-facto alternative for the other nine locales was the general 1–3-`LETTER` shape veto, which
   bought the same protection by declining **every** short quotation in **every** locale —
   a much larger and commoner error class than quoting a single letter, and one this repository's
   own promo examples tripped over in `ru`, `fr`, `fr-CA`, `fi` and `sv`. 1.1.0 takes the smaller
   error knowingly, and N1/N2 stay pinned so it is visible rather than forgotten.
   The evidentiary notes that governed per-locale entries are retained because they still govern
   `elisionIdioms` itself, which is unchanged: `en-GB` has no independent citation and carries an
   extra risk the other locales do not, since its primary pair *is* the single quote, so `'n'` is
   more plausible as genuine quoted dialogue there than in a locale whose primary pair is double;
   and `fi`/`sv` write the idiom **closed up** (`rock'n'roll`) in their own dictionaries, so a
   spaced-form entry there would be evidenced-inert. Neither observation blocks the universal
   veto, which rests on the operator decision rather than on per-locale citation. **Still open,
   all locales:** `en-GB` single-first (now more consequential under mandate 1); quotation across
   a paragraph boundary; nesting deeper than 2; primes; surviving-mark invisibility to the
   conformance matrix.
9. **`ru`/`el`/`fr`/`fr-CA` already-curly protection is narrower than 0.1.0's** for these
   same-width-primary/secondary locales specifically — the two-stack split no longer
   independently protects already-curly text there the way it protects freshly-typed straight
   text. §6's dedicated adversarial sweep found no failures, but the protection that remains is
   the vetoes and the gate, not an independent structural guarantee.

10. **The span-boundary defect is closed for a cited fragment and open for everything else
    (spec 1.4.0).** §3.2's span-boundary elision veto reads `quotes.elisionClitics`, so a locale
    with empty lists is classified exactly as 1.3.1 classified it — issue #53's inversion is
    still reachable there, and the fix for that locale is a cited entry, not a change to this
    rule. Two shapes stay open in **every** locale, both for the same reason: the attaching
    fragment is not there to read. A plural possessive after a span (`` `xs`' ``) has an empty
    run and is byte-identical to a closing mark after a span (§4) — **this is issue #53 §3, the
    cross-paragraph witness that motivated the report, and it is decided rather than open — §3.2
    gives the two measurements and issue #54 records the close**; and a fragment written in
    capitals (`QU'<em>il</em>`) fails the first-code-point folding this rule shares with item 8's
    listed veto. Neither is a candidate for a wider mechanism: widening the folding is
    `ARCHITECTURE.md` §4.4's banned territory, and the plural possessive has no local evidence at
    all.

## History

0.1.0 shipped with the four-pass, `STRAIGHT`-only design whose idempotency proof is quoted and
withdrawn in §0/§5 above. 0.2.0 was `dashes`' version bump and did not touch this file. 0.3.0 is
the revision described through most of this document: mandates 1 and 2, the five-pass
algorithm, the certification gate, and the locale-schema constraints in §2.1.

0.4.0 adds the **listed elision veto** (§2, §3.2): `quotes.elisionIdioms`, a locale-data list of
`{ left, elided, right }` triples that declines to pair two `NARROW` marks as a quotation when
the full surrounding context matches a configured idiom, closing the `rock 'n' roll` defect
(§7 item 8) for `en-US`. A first design considered during the same development — a bare
`elisionForms` word list matching only the elided content — was reviewed and rejected before
any commit or release once it was found to falsely elide ordinary quotations of a single letter
(`The letter 'n' is common.`); it never shipped. §6's `N1`/`N2` rows and this history entry
exist so that design is not silently reintroduced.

0.5.0 adds the **general ambiguous-medial-span veto** (§3.2), closing the same class of defect for
every locale without a cited `elisionIdioms` entry — not by inferring an idiom, but by preserving
the author's straight ASCII marks unconverted. The shared predicate this and `apostrophe`
(order 50) both consult lives in one module, `src/rules/quote-ambiguity.ts` (JS reference
implementation), specifically so `apostrophe`'s own structural case ladder cannot independently
curl a mark this rule has deliberately left alone — see `apostrophe.md` §3.4 for why that
composition risk was real, not hypothetical.

1.1.0 **replaces 0.5.0's veto with the universal medial-`n` elision veto** (§3.2), on the operator
decision of 2026-09-09 that `rock 'n' roll` and `rock'n'roll` are international and take U+2019 in
every locale. Three things change together, and none of them works without the other two:

- **The shape narrows** from 1–3 `LETTER` code points to exactly one code point, U+006E or U+004E.
  0.5.0's shape could not distinguish the idiom from an ordinary short nested quotation and
  declined both, which is what made `«это 'моё' дело»` and `“He said 'no' to me,”` come out with
  the inner marks unconverted. It was also normalization-dependent, since `LETTER` includes `Mn`.
- **The outcome inverts** from preserve to convert: matched marks are no longer held back from
  `apostrophe`, which renders each by its ordinary case ladder. 0.5.0's preserve set
  (`computePreserveIndices`, `apostrophe.md` §3.4) is withdrawn along with the reason it existed.
- **The predicate widens** from straight ASCII to the whole `NARROW` class. This is forced by the
  second change, not chosen: a veto that produces U+2019 must recognise U+2019, or its own output
  pairs as a quotation on the next pipeline pass. A straight-only predicate was implemented first
  and measured to do exactly that — `rock ’n’ roll` → `rock «n» roll` in `ru`, `rock ”n” roll` in
  `fi` — an idempotency violation and so a release blocker.

The cost accepted, knowingly and with §6's N1/N2 rows kept as its permanent witnesses, is that a
genuine quotation of the letter *n* is elided. §7 item 8 records why that is the smaller error
than the class 0.5.0 traded it for.

1.4.0 adds the **span-boundary elision veto** (§2, §3.2): `quotes.elisionClitics`, two
locale-data lists of the word fragments that attach across an elision or possessive apostrophe,
consulted only when the mark is flush against an inline span boundary. It closes **issue #53
§1** — a possessive or elision written against a span (`` `x`'s ``, `l'<em>idée</em>`) was
classified as a quotation candidate, took the pairing from the author's own mark inside a
quotation, and inverted the pair in every locale. **It does not close issue #53 §3**, the
cross-paragraph damage that motivated the report, which was tracked separately as issue #54 and
is decided rather than fixed (2026-09-24, §3.2): that witness is a *plural* possessive after a
span, and §3.2 records why no veto over these neighbours can reach it. The simpler design — letting the boundary marker satisfy the
medial-elision veto's `ALNUM` test — was implemented, measured, and rejected before any release:
it breaks a quotation that legitimately begins or ends at a span boundary, including the
released fixture `en-us-markdown-commonmark-boundary-nested-quotes` and the `NARROW` forms of
`modes.md` §3.3's normative rows — not their `WIDE` forms, which both vetoes leave alone. §3.2 records that measurement, the accepted false positive (a quotation whose
whole content is one listed fragment), and the one shape no veto over these neighbours can
reach — the plural possessive, which is byte-identical to a closing mark after a span.

1.6.2 corrects §3.2's own measurements of the decision above; no behaviour, fixture or locale
field changes. Two errors, both introduced with the decision record on 2026-09-24 and both
overstating how cheap the decided behaviour is. The first claimed the glyph at the possessive's
position was "correct either way" — it is not: `apostrophe` cannot reach a mark whose left
neighbour is the inline `MARKER`, so declining the pairing leaves U+0027 there, measured on the
published 1.6.1 package. The second counted **7 of 2801 conformance cases** where 2801 is
polytypo-js's vitest test total, a figure no other runtime can reproduce; the cost is **6 of the
1366 fixture cases**, and the sixth — this section's own `en-GB` fixture — is now described
rather than left in the count, because the veto moves the pair to the author's mark correctly and
moves the typewriter apostrophe to the possessive at the same time. A conformance count in this
document is a count of fixture cases, never of one runner's tests.
