# Rule: `ranges`

**Order:** 25. **Default:** off. **Modes:** text, html, markdown, yaml.
**Spec version:** 0.5.0 (new rule; split out of `dashes`); §3.2a (closed-up symbols) new in 1.3.0.

---

## 1. Purpose

`ranges` recognises the numeric/date **range dash** — `1914–1918` — and renders it in the form
the locale prescribes. It is the second of the two typographic uses `dashes` (order 30) used to
own; the two rules together still cover exactly the same input shape `dashes` alone used to
(spec ≤ 0.4.1), split apart because they now carry **different default-on status**.

**Why this is a separate opt-in rule rather than a bounded fix inside `dashes`.** A digit-flanked
hyphen shaped `5-10` is genuinely ambiguous without knowing the word that precedes it:

- `takes 5-10 days`, `aged 9-10 years`, `pages 5-10`, `0-60`, `€30-80` — genuine ranges. Converting
  the hyphen to the locale's dash is correct.
- `Figure 5-10`, `Table 3-12`, `Section 2-14` — **compound labels**, not ranges (they mean "figure
  10 in chapter 5" — chapter-and-item, not a span). Converting the hyphen here is a false positive
  that reads oddly to a careful proofreader, even though it is rarely noticed casually.
- `9-11`, `7-11` — bare proper nouns (a date, a convenience-store chain) that happen to have the
  identical digit-hyphen-digit shape and are neither a label nor a range.

Separating the first case from the second and third needs the word immediately before the
hyphen's left digit run — `Figure`, `Table`, `Section`, `Fig.`, `Abb.`, `рис.` — which is an
open-ended, per-locale, per-house-style word list with no natural closure
([dashes.md](dashes.md) §7.11, carried forward unchanged from when this algorithm lived there).
`locale.schema.json` could hold such a list as literal strings, but populating it would mean
either (a) inventing entries with no normative citation — forbidden by this project's evidence
discipline (PLAN.md §6.1) — or (b) leaving it empty, which is not a fix, only a schema field that
looks like one. Neither the bare digit-hyphen-digit shape nor a label word list gives a
**structurally closed, portable** rule that never produces a false positive: this project's rules
scan code points, not words with real-world referents, and are built never to consult that kind
of context (ARCHITECTURE.md §4.1).

**The resolution is: make range conversion something the caller explicitly asks for, and leave it
off by default.** With `ranges` off (the default), `5-10`, `Figure 5-10`, `9-11` and `7-11` are
all byte-identical no-ops — the compound-label false positive cannot occur, because nothing in
this class converts at all. A caller who explicitly opts in (`{ rules: { ranges: true } }`) is
choosing to accept the residual, structurally irreducible ambiguity between a genuine range and a
same-shaped label or proper noun, in exchange for genuine ranges being typeset correctly. This is
a documented tradeoff, not a claim of reliable label detection — see §5.

---

## 2. Locale data consumed

- `dash.range` — one of `"em-tight"`, `"em-spaced"`, `"en-tight"`, `"en-spaced"`, `"none"`. The
  **same field**, under the **same locale JSON key**, `dashes` has always read for range styling
  — this rule's split from `dashes` moves which rule reads it, not what the field means or which
  citations support it. No new locale claim is made by this document (operator decision, spec
  0.5.0): every `dash.range` value in `spec/locales/*.json` is unchanged from spec 0.4.1.

`"none"` means the locale has no verified range convention, and this rule must emit nothing at
all for a range token in that locale — not a fallback to `dash.parenthetical`, nothing.

---

## 3. Algorithm

Input is a code-point array `cp[0 … n-1]`. Character classes (`DASH`, `DIGIT`, `LETTER`, `SPACE`,
`BREAK`, `NOBREAK-SPACE`, `INERT-DASH`, `JOINER`) are exactly [dashes.md](dashes.md) §3.1's —
this rule and `dashes` read the same input alphabet, because both scan the same DASH-token shape
before diverging on what each does with it.

### 3.1 The dash token (shared with `dashes`)

Steps 1-7 of [dashes.md](dashes.md) §3.2 — run detection, the length-3 decoration cutoff, outer
spacing, the symmetry guard, the content-on-both-sides guard, the joiner-crossing walk (§3.2a),
the isolation guard and the cluster guard (§3.2 step 7) — apply here **identically, unchanged**.
A token that `dashes`' §3.2 steps would decline is declined here too, for the same reasons; the
two rules diverge only starting at §3.3 below. The JS reference implementation shares one
internal module (`src/rules/dash-shared.ts`) between `src/rules/dashes.ts` and
`src/rules/ranges.ts` for exactly this reason — a port is free to structure its own module
boundary differently, but must reproduce the same shared guard behaviour in both rules, not two
independent approximations of it.

`JOINER`-crossing re-entry (dashes.md §3.2a's third bullet: "if a joiner was crossed and
`cp[L*]`/`cp[R*]` are both `DIGIT`, the token is a bound range this rule produced on an earlier
pass") is **this rule's own** re-entry condition — it is how a tight range this rule already
converted survives a second pipeline pass without regrowing a second joiner. `dashes` shares the
same joiner-crossing walk (it must, to correctly decline a token immediately touching a range
this rule already produced) but never itself owns that re-entry: any joiner adjacent to a token
that is **not a range candidate** (§3.2, §3.2a — wider than "digit-flanked" as of spec 1.3.0) is
declined outright (dashes.md §3.2a's fourth bullet).

### 3.2 Range guards (G1-G5)

The token is a **range candidate** iff `cp[L']` is in `DIGIT` **and** `cp[R']` is in `DIGIT` —
`L` and `R` after the joiner-crossing walk of §3.1, and `L'`/`R'` after the closed-up-symbol walk
of §3.2a, which moves neither index unless a symbol is there to consume. If it is a range
candidate, this rule owns it exclusively: `dashes` never processes it, whether or not `ranges` is
enabled (operator decision, spec 0.5.0 — see [dashes.md](dashes.md) §1). If it is **not** a range
candidate (either flank is not `DIGIT` after that walk), this rule emits nothing for it at all;
it is `dashes`' concern or no rule's.

Compute `Lrun`, `Rrun`, `before`, `after` exactly as [dashes.md](dashes.md) §3.3 (pre-0.5.0)
specified — reproduced here verbatim since this is now its own rule document, with `L'`/`R'`
where it said `L`/`R`:

- `Lrun` = the maximal run of `DIGIT` ending at `L'` (indices `a … L'`);
- `Rrun` = the maximal run of `DIGIT` starting at `R'` (indices `R' … b`);
- `before` = the **effective neighbour** (dashes.md §3.2b) to the left of index `a`, except as
  §3.2a amends it;
- `after` = the **effective neighbour** to the right of index `b`, except as §3.2a amends it.

All five guards must pass:

- **G1 — no letter adjacency.** `before` is not in `LETTER`. (`MP3-4`, `H2-2` rejected. `COVID-19`
  is already rejected earlier, because `cp[L]` is `D`, a letter, not a digit.)
- **G2 — no chain.** `before` is not in `DASH` and not in `INERT-DASH`; `after` is not in `DASH`
  and not in `INERT-DASH`. This protects `2026-08-15`, `978-3-16-148410-0` and `212-555-1234`.
  **This guard reads the input as it stood before this rule (or `dashes`) made any edit in this
  pipeline pass** — see §4's note on why `ranges` runs before `dashes`: evaluating G2 against an
  adjacency `dashes` just created (by removing a space next to this token) rather than against
  what the author actually typed is exactly the defect §4 documents and the reason for the chosen
  order.
- **G3 — not part of a decimal or path.** `before` is not U+002E, U+002C or U+002F; `after` is
  not U+002F. `1.5-2.5` and `01/02-03/04` are left alone.
- **G4 — run lengths.** Either `length(Lrun) = length(Rrun)`, **or** `length(Lrun) = 1` and
  `length(Rrun) = 2` and `Rrun` does not begin with U+0030. `1914-1918` (4,4) passes; `5-10` (1,2)
  passes; `0-60` (1,2) passes; `ISO 8859-1` (4,1) fails; `555-1234` (3,4) fails; `1-800` (1,3)
  fails; `2020-24` (4,2) fails; `10-7` (2,1) fails; `9-05` fails on the leading zero. See
  [dashes.md](dashes.md) §3.3's historical discussion of why this exact shape and not a wider one
  — unchanged, reproduced there rather than duplicated here since it is a proof about G5's
  correctness, not new content this rule's split needs to restate.
- **G5 — non-decreasing.** The integer value of `Lrun` ≤ the integer value of `Rrun`, compared
  digit-by-digit left to right (sound only because G4 guarantees equal length in the only branch
  where G5 does work). `1914-1918` passes; `1234-5678` passes; `20-10` fails.

If any guard fails, emit nothing. **The token is not reconsidered by `dashes`.** A stroke between
two digits is a range or it is nothing; `dashes` never sees it (§3.1 above).

### 3.2a Closed-up symbols on both members (spec 1.3.0)

Before spec 1.3.0 a range whose members each carried a symbol — `$15-$20`, `35%-50%` — was not a
range candidate, because the flank next to the dash was the symbol and not a `DIGIT`. `$15-20`
converted and `$15-$20` did not; `15-20%` converted and `15%-20%` did not. The asymmetry was a
consequence of where the symbol sits relative to the digit run, never a decision anyone made.

**The distinction the source draws is closed-up versus spaced, not currency versus unit.**

> "the abbreviation or symbol is repeated if it is closed up to the number but not if it is
> separated: 35%–50%" — *The Chicago Manual of Style*, 18th ed., 9.19, quoted in the freely
> readable [CMOS Online Q&A, "Numbers"](https://www.chicagomanualofstyle.org/qanda/data/faq/topics/Numbers/faq0024.html);
> the same paragraph is applied to money on
> [page 5 of that topic](https://www.chicagomanualofstyle.org/qanda/data/faq/topics/Numbers.html?page=5):
> "in Chicago style an abbreviation or symbol is repeated if it is closed up to a number but not
> if it is separated by a space: $3–$5 million".

So `$15–$20` and `35%–50%` are one rule, and `15 kg–20 kg` is not that rule — `kg` is separated
by a space, and the source says a separated abbreviation is **not** repeated. The elided forms
`$3–5 million` and `15–20%` are permitted variants the same answer calls acceptable; they already
convert and keep converting.

**`CLOSED-SYMBOL`** is a literal code-point set, fixed here and not locale data:

> U+0024, U+00A2, U+00A3, U+00A4, U+00A5, every code point from U+20A0 through U+20CF inclusive
> (the whole Currency Symbols block, assigned or not), U+0025, U+2030, U+2031, and U+00B0.

`$` and `%` are the source's own examples; the rest are the same class by the source's own
wording — symbols conventionally written closed up to a number: the other currency signs,
per-mille and per-ten-thousand, and the degree sign. It is written as literal code points rather
than a Unicode category test for the same reason `DIGIT` is ASCII-only (§7.1): a category test
makes the rule's verdict depend on which Unicode version a runtime was built against, and the
five runtimes must agree. The currency range is the **block's own bounds**, U+20A0–U+20CF, not
the subset assigned in some Unicode version — block bounds never move, while the assigned subset
does, and a rule that admitted only today's assignments would drift between runtimes built
against different UCD releases. Unassigned code points inside the block are members of the set
and unreachable in valid text; a code point assigned there later is a currency sign by the
block's own definition, and membership is then already correct without a spec change. `+`, `-`, `#`, `(`, `)` and the quotation marks are **not** members and
must not be added on the reasoning that they are also written closed up: none is a symbol this
source's rule is about, and each would admit a shape (`+15-+20`, `#15-#20`, `"15"-"20"`) nobody
has asked for and no citation supports.

**The walk.** Both sides are decided **from the original `L` and `R`, simultaneously**, before
either index moves — never left-then-right or right-then-left. Otherwise a token whose flanks are
both in `CLOSED-SYMBOL` (`%15%-%20%`) would have a verdict that depends on evaluation order, and
two runtimes could disagree while both following this document. After the joiner-crossing walk of
§3.1 has produced `L` and `R`:

- **right:** if `cp[R]` is in `CLOSED-SYMBOL` **and** `cp[R + 1]` exists and is in `DIGIT`, then
  `R' = R + 1` and the **inner right symbol** is `cp[R]`. Otherwise `R' = R` and there is none.
- **left:** if `cp[L]` is in `CLOSED-SYMBOL` **and** `cp[L - 1]` exists and is in `DIGIT`, then
  `L' = L - 1` and the **inner left symbol** is `cp[L]`. Otherwise `L' = L` and there is none.

Each side consumes **at most one** code point, so `US$15-US$20` and `15°C-20°C` are not
admitted — and the mechanism is candidacy, not a guard: `cp[R]` is `U` and `cp[L]` is `C`,
neither is in `CLOSED-SYMBOL`, so no walk is taken and the flank is simply not a `DIGIT`. The
half-written `US$15-$20` **is** a candidate (the right walk matches the outer `$` in front of
`15`) and is declined by G1 instead, because `before` reads past that `$` and finds `S`. Both are
recorded in §7.7.

**The outer symbols** are the effective neighbour (dashes.md §3.2b) immediately left of `Lrun`'s
first index `a`, and immediately right of `Rrun`'s last index `b`, when that code point is in
`CLOSED-SYMBOL`.

**Matching, and it is exact.** A side's walk is taken **only if** the symbol it would consume is
matched on the opposite member: an inner right symbol must be the **same code point** as the
outer left symbol, and an inner left symbol the same code point as the outer right symbol. Not a
currency-equivalence table, not a per-locale list: the same code point.

**An unmatched symbol means the walk is not taken at all**, so the flank stays a non-`DIGIT`, the
token is **not** a range candidate, and it remains `dashes`' concern exactly as it was before
spec 1.3.0. `$15-€20` is a currency conversion, not a range; `15-$20` and `15%-20` are
half-written. None of the three changes hands, and none of them changes behaviour in this spec
version.

If a side has **no inner symbol**, the corresponding outer symbol is not examined at all, which
is exactly what keeps `$15-20` and `15-20%` converting as they did before this section existed.

**What this does not change.** `Rrun` is the maximal `DIGIT` run starting at `R'` and `Lrun` the
one ending at `L'`; wherever the shared guards of §3.1 and the replacement of §3.3 say `cp[L]` or
`cp[R]`, this rule reads `cp[L']` or `cp[R']`. **G4 and G5 are untouched** — they compare digit
runs and never see a symbol. The edit span is untouched too: the replacement covers the dash run
(and, when binding, the joiners adjacent to it), so a symbol is never inserted, removed or
rewritten. This rule changes one dash and nothing else.

**G1, G2 and G3 judge the same position they always did.** When an inner right symbol was
matched, `before` is the effective neighbour left of the **outer left symbol** rather than left of
`a`; when an inner left symbol was matched, `after` is the effective neighbour right of the
**outer right symbol** rather than right of `b`. In every other case `before` and `after` are
unchanged. So `US$15-$20` has `before` = `S`, a `LETTER`, and G1 declines it.

**Idempotency, and the two shared guards this section forced open.** A bound `$15⁠–⁠$20`
re-enters through §3.1's joiner-crossing walk, whose re-entry condition
([dashes.md](dashes.md) §3.2a) is amended in this same spec version to read `cp[L']`/`cp[R']`;
having re-entered, §3.3's identical-replacement test makes the second pass a no-op.

That is the easy half. The hard half is that widening what counts as a range member widens what
a **`dashes`** edit elsewhere in the text can disturb, and `dashes`' spacing-transition guard was
keyed to `DIGIT`.

**T1** ([dashes.md](dashes.md) §3.2 step 8) both gated its branches on a `DIGIT` flank and walked
outward from the digit run without stepping over a symbol, so a tight `dashes` token next to a
closed-up range member became spaced, that U+0020 replaced the range's `before` or `after`, and
the range converted on the **next** pass. Four witnesses, one per position and side, each drifting
where its all-digit analogue was already inert: `a—$15-$20`, `35%-50%—b`, `a--15% - 20%` and
`$1 - $1--a`. T1's reach is `CLOSED-SYMBOL`-transparent at two positions per side as of spec
1.3.0, and each witness is pinned by a fixture asserting that the input is now a **no-op** —
which is what a conformance runner can see, since it cannot run a second pass and compare.

**This is deliberately T1 and not the cluster guard** ([dashes.md](dashes.md) §3.2 step 7), which
would have closed the same defect by putting `CLOSED-SYMBOL` in its alphabet. That guard is
unconditional, so it would also have made `price--$50--drop` inert in an `em-tight` locale that
has no defect to fix; T1 fires only on the tight-to-spaced transition that can actually disturb a
neighbour. The alternative was implemented, measured and rejected on that comparison.

**The cost this leaves.** In a locale whose `dash.parenthetical` is **spaced**, a tight token
next to a closed-up range member no longer converts: `Anstieg--50%--war` is left alone in
`de-DE`, where spec 1.2.0 gave `Anstieg – 50% – war` (measured). The all-digit
`Anstieg--50--war` has always been left alone, so the two agree; and a locale with a tight
parenthetical form never reaches the guard, so `price--$50--drop` still becomes `price—$50—drop`
in `en-US`. **The remedy is unconditional on `dash.range`, while the defect was not**: the
conversion loss therefore also lands in `fr`, `fr-CA`, `it`, `nl`, `pt-BR` and `pt-PT`, whose
`dash.range` is `"none"` and which never had a range verdict to disturb. Making T1 consult
`dash.range` would make a `dashes` verdict depend on a field `dashes` does not read, which is a
worse trade than a conversion nobody has asked for in six locales.

**The accepted cost, stated plainly.** Widening candidacy moves tokens **out of** `dashes`, and
`ranges` is off by default, so text that `dashes` used to change now changes only when a caller
turns `ranges` on — and in the eight locales whose `dash.range` is `"none"`, not even then:
`$15 - $20` gave `$15 — $20` in `fr` through spec 1.2.0 and is a permanent no-op from 1.3.0. The affected shapes are the **spaced and multi-hyphen** ones, because a lone
tight hyphen between two non-spaces was never converted by `dashes` either: `$15 - $20` gave
`$15—$20` in `en-US` before this section and is a no-op with default options after it, while
`$15-$20` was already a no-op and now converts when `ranges` is on. That is the same behaviour `$15 - 20` has had since spec 0.5.0 — the
change makes the two consistent rather than introducing an inconsistency — and the alternative is
worse than the cost: declining `$15-$20` does not leave `$15–20`, it leaves `$15-$20`, a hyphen
where every reading of every source above wants a dash.

### 3.3 Replacement

If all guards pass, emit one edit replacing `cp[s - lsp … e - 1 + rsp]` with:

| `dash.range`  | replacement                                             |
| ------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| `"em-tight"`  | U+2014                                                    |
| `"em-spaced"` | U+0020 U+2014 U+0020                                      |
| `"en-tight"`  | U+2013                                                    |
| `"en-spaced"` | U+0020 U+2013 U+0020                                      |
| `"none"`      | _(emit nothing — the token is left exactly as written)_   |

Subject to guards T1 and T2 ([dashes.md](dashes.md) §3.2 steps 8-9, `isSpacingTransitionBlocked`
and the strip-before/open-bracket checks — shared, unchanged, evaluated here against
`dash.range`'s chosen form exactly as they were against either branch's form pre-0.5.0). If the
replacement is identical, code point for code point, to the span it would replace, emit nothing
instead.

#### 3.3.1 Binding a tight range

Unchanged from [dashes.md](dashes.md) §3.3.1 (pre-0.5.0), reproduced here since binding is now
exclusively this rule's behaviour: when the chosen `dash.range` form is `-tight` and all guards
have passed, the emitted replacement is `JOINER dash JOINER` (U+2060, the dash, U+2060), and the
edit span covers any `JOINER` already adjacent to the token — the range is a single lexical unit
(UAX #14 gives U+2013/U+2014 the line-break class `BA`, and Мильчин and Chicago both forbid
breaking a range in running text). A range already in its exact target form is never bound (the
invisible-edit test: compute the unbound replacement first; if it is already a no-op, stay
unbound). `dashes` never emits a joiner — an interrupting parenthetical dash is exactly where a
line **may** break.

### 3.4 Continue, non-overlap, no-break spaces

[dashes.md](dashes.md) §3.5 (continue/non-overlap) and §3.6 (no-break spaces are never touched)
apply to this rule exactly as written there — both are properties of the shared token shape
(§3.1), not of which branch/rule a token ends up in.

---

## 4. Rule order: why `ranges` runs before `dashes`

`ranges` is order 25, `dashes` is order 30 — `ranges` runs first. This was chosen from an
observed behavioural difference, not for convenience.

The pre-0.5.0 unified `dashes` rule found every dash token's edits in **one scan over the
unedited input**, then applied all of them together — so every token's guards, including G2's
cross-token "no chain" check, always read the original, unedited adjacency structure, regardless
of which other tokens in the same document were also converting. Splitting `ranges` and `dashes`
into two sequential rule passes means one of them necessarily sees the other's *output*, not the
original input, for whichever positions the first rule touched.

**Concrete case: `a - 5-10`** (a parenthetical dash directly followed, by one space, by a
genuine range). `en-US`: `dash.parenthetical = "em-tight"`, `dash.range = "en-tight"`.

- **`ranges` first:** `ranges` scans the original text; the range token's `before` (G2) is the
  space at index 3, not a dash, so G2 passes and `5-10` becomes `5⁠–⁠10`. `dashes` then scans
  `a - 5⁠–⁠10`; its own token (`a - 5`) is unaffected by the far-away range edit and converts to
  `a—5⁠–⁠10` normally. **Final: `a—5⁠–⁠10`.**
- **`dashes` first:** `dashes` converts `a - 5` to `a—5` (its `em-tight` form has no spaces, so
  the edit span swallows the space that used to separate the parenthetical dash from the digit
  run). `ranges` then scans `a—5-10`; the range token's `before` (G2) is now the em-dash
  `dashes` just emitted, immediately adjacent (no space) — G2 reads this as a **chain** (the same
  shape as `978-3-16-148410-0`) and declines. **Final: `a—5-10`** — the range is silently never
  converted, purely because of which rule happened to run first, not because of anything either
  rule's own guards were designed to protect.

`ranges`-before-`dashes` reproduces the pre-0.5.0 unified rule's output (`a—5⁠–⁠10`) exactly;
`dashes`-before-`ranges` introduces a new, order-induced decline that never happened before the
split. `tests/rules/ranges.test.ts` and `tests/rules/dashes.test.ts` pin this case as a fixed
regression witness. This is a single reproducible counter-example, not an exhaustive proof that
no input ever favours the opposite order — but it is evidence in one concrete direction, and
`ranges`-before-`dashes` is kept on that evidence, not on a preference between two otherwise
indistinguishable choices.

---

## 5. What this rule does not, and cannot, solve

**`ranges` converts `Figure 5-10` to `Figure 5⁠–⁠10` when explicitly enabled**, exactly as it
converts a genuine range. This is not an oversight this document is unaware of — it is the
residual ambiguity §1 names as the reason the rule is opt-in. Enabling `ranges` is an explicit
choice to accept that a compound label sharing the digit-hyphen-digit shape will be converted
alongside genuine ranges; the caller has no bounded, cited mechanism this project can offer to
tell the two apart (§1). A future spec version could add a cited, closed `dash.labelWords` list
per locale (dashes.md §7.11's own suggestion) if and when locale-authority research produces
citable evidence for specific label words in specific locales — no such citation exists as of
spec 0.5.0, and an empty or invented list is not that fix (§1).

---

## 6. Worked examples

`⟨J⟩` = U+2060 (word joiner), `⟶` = no change. **Every row in this table requires
`{ rules: { ranges: true } }` explicitly** — `ranges` is off by default (§1), so every one of
these inputs is a byte-identical no-op with default options; that default-options behaviour is
what canonical fixtures (`spec/fixtures/*.json`) assert. These rows describe this rule's own
conversion behaviour once explicitly enabled — they were relocated here, verbatim, from
`dashes.md` §6 (rows 3, 3a-3j, 13, 17), which owned range detection through spec 0.4.1.

**A row containing an invisible code point must be checked in the escaped mirror, never read** —
U+2060 is zero-width, so a row that omits it looks correct on screen and is wrong at the byte

| 54  | `35%-50%`           | `35%⟨J⟩–⟨J⟩50%`            | the suffix mirror — the walk moves the **left** flank, and the match is against the outer symbol after `Rrun`. The literal example in the sentence §3.2a quotes  |

| 57  | `15-$20`            | ⟶                          | an inner symbol with no matching outer one. The match is required in both directions                                                                            |

| 59  | `$15-20 and 15-20%` | `$15⟨J⟩–⟨J⟩20 and 15⟨J⟩–⟨J⟩20%` | the elided forms, unchanged by §3.2a — the outer symbol is examined only when there is an inner one to match                                                |

## 7. Open questions

Every item below is current and open against `ranges` specifically. Items that are shared
machinery rather than range-specific stay in [dashes.md](dashes.md) §7 (its canonical home,
§3.1 above); items that are purely historical are [dashes.md](dashes.md) §8.

1. **`DIGIT` is ASCII-only** (the class itself is defined in [dashes.md](dashes.md) §3.1, shared
   with `dashes`). Arabic-Indic, Devanagari and fullwidth digits are not recognised, so
   `١٩١٤-١٩١٨` is left alone. The limitation lands here rather than in `dashes.md` §7 because only
   `ranges`' G4/G5 actually read a digit's *value* — `dashes` never does. Extending to Unicode
   `Nd` would require every runtime to agree on a Unicode version _and_ a digit-value table;
   ASCII-only is the portable choice for the v1 locale set. Recorded so the limitation is
   deliberate rather than accidental.
2. **Decimal ranges.** `1.5-2.5` and `1,5-2,5` are legitimate ranges and are currently rejected
   by G3. Supporting them means deciding which of U+002E / U+002C is the decimal separator in a
   given locale, which is data the schema does not carry. Left unsupported.
3. **Abbreviated year ranges.** `2020-24` is a real convention (Chicago) and is rejected by G4.
   The false-positive risk of relaxing G4 (it would also accept `8859-1`) was judged worse than
   the miss. Needs an operator decision.
4. **Scores and votes.** `5-0`, `2-1` pass all guards and become en dashes. That is arguably
   correct typographically (an en dash is standard for scores), but G5 rejects `5-0` while
   accepting `0-5`, which is inconsistent for this use. Either scores are out of scope or G5
   needs an exception; unresolved.
5. **The U+2060 range binding is invisible in both the rendered text and a plain diff, and that
   is a reviewing hazard, not just a curiosity.** Every other change this rule makes is catchable
   by eye — a hyphen becomes a dash, a space appears or disappears. §3.3.1's joiner is zero-width:
   a bound form and its unbound equivalent are pixel-identical in every font, and a unified diff
   shows a changed line with no visible difference on it. **A worked-example or fixture row that
   omits the joiner looks correct on screen and is wrong at the byte level** — §6's own standing
   note says so, and the escaped mirror in `spec/fixtures/.escaped/` is the only rendering in
   which the joiner is visible; check it, never read the row on screen. This is not an argument
   against the binding, which is well-sourced and correct, only a property this rule (and any
   future rule emitting a zero-width or invisible code point — U+00AD, U+200B, a variation
   selector) has to manage explicitly rather than assume a reviewer will catch by eye. The
   historical cost of this exact hazard — 32 fixture cases silently broken, and one idempotency
   defect needing a seven-character witness — is recorded at [dashes.md](dashes.md) §8.6, from
   when this rule's behaviour still lived there.
6. **The compound-label ambiguity (`Figure 5-10`, G4's `(1,2)` branch) is already the full current
   statement of this rule's central tradeoff — see §5 above, not duplicated here.**
7. **A multi-code-point closed-up symbol is not admitted** (§3.2a). `US$15-US$20` and `R$15-R$20`
   carry a two- or three-code-point prefix, and `15°C-20°C` a two-code-point suffix; §3.2a
   consumes at most one code point per side, so all three are declined. Admitting them means
   deciding how far to walk and what stops the walk, and a walk that crosses `LETTER` would
   collide with G1, which exists to keep `MP3-4` and `H2-2` out. The narrow rule is the one the
   citation supports; the wider one needs its own evidence.
8. **A spaced unit is deliberately out of scope, and so is the mirror case.** `15 kg-20 kg` and
   `225 nm-2400 nm` are not admitted, because the source §3.2a quotes says a symbol *separated by
   a space* is **not** repeated — the spaced form is a different construction, and NIST SP 811
   §7.7 goes further and recommends the word "to" rather than a range dash for quantities, on the
   ground that a dash can be read as a minus sign. Separately: in `de-DE`, `fr` and `ru` the
   currency sign follows the amount (`30 EUR`, `800 руб.`), so the money case in those locales is
   shaped `15 €-20 €` — a spaced symbol, not a closed-up one, and therefore out of scope by the
   same clause rather than by oversight. Whether a spaced, repeated unit should be admitted at
   all is an open question with evidence pointing away from it.
   **This is also why a `CLOSED-SYMBOL` member appearing in a locale's `nbsp.beforeUnits` does
   not contradict the locale data.** Several locale files list `°C`, and some list `%`, as units
   the locale sets **after a space** — `20 °C`, `20 %`. That is the spaced construction, out of
   scope here; `15°-20°` and `35%-50%`, with the symbol closed up, are the other one. The two
   never meet in the algorithm either: §3.2a's walk requires a `DIGIT` immediately beside the
   symbol, so `15 %-20 %` is not a candidate at all.
